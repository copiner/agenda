Mrs. Garstin was a hard, cruel, managing, ambitious, parsimonious and
stupid woman.

Bernard Garstin was painstaking, industrious and capable
but he had not the will to advance himself. Mrs. Garstin despised him. 
But she recognised,
though with bitterness, that she could only achieve success through him, and
she set herself to drive him on the way she desired to go. She nagged him
without mercy.
She discovered that if she wanted him to do something which
his sensitiveness revolted against she had only to give him no peace and
eventually, exhausted, he would yield. 

On her side she set herself to cultivate
the people who might be useful. She flattered the solicitors who would send
her husband briefs and was familiar with their wives. She was obsequious to
the judges and their ladies. She made much of promising politicians.

halved

His misgivings were justified. He made no headway as a leader and his
briefs were few. But he concealed any disappointment he may have felt, and
if he reproached his wife it was in his heart. He grew perhaps a little more
silent, but he had always been silent at home, and no one in his family
noticed a change in him. His daughters had never looked upon him as
anything but a source of income; it had always seemed perfectly natural that
he should lead a dog’s life in order to provide them with board and lodging,
clothes, holidays and money for odds and ends; and now, understanding that
through his fault money was less plentiful, the indifference they had felt for
him was tinged with an exasperated contempt. It never occurred to them to
ask themselves what were the feelings of the subdued little man who went out
early in the morning and came home at night only in time to dress for dinner.
He was a stranger to them, but because he was their father they took it for
granted that he should love and cherish them.

He was very reserved. All she knew about his antecedents, his birth, his

questioning.

contemptuous

She wondered why he had ever fallen in love with her. She could not
imagine any one less suited than herself to this restrained, cold and selfpossessed man. And yet it was quite certain that he loved her madly. He
would do anything in the world to please her. He was like wax in her hands.
When she thought of one side he showed her, a side which only she had seen,
she a little despised him. She wondered whether his sarcastic manner, with its
contemptuous tolerance for so many persons and things she admired, was
merely a façade to conceal a profound weakness. She supposed he was
clever, every one seemed to think he was, but except very occasionally when
he was with two or three people he liked and was in the mood, she had never
found him entertaining. He did not precisely bore her, he left her indifferent.

strolled

there was a caressing
sound in his deep, rich voice, a delightful expression in his kind, shining blue
eyes, which made you feel very much at home with him. Of course he had
charm. That was what made him so pleasant.

His face was deeply
sunburned, but the sun had not taken the healthy colour from his cheeks. She
liked the little trim curly moustache which did not conceal his full red lips.
He had black hair, short and brushed very sleek. But of course his eyes, under
thick, bushy eyebrows, were his best feature: they were so very blue, and
they had a laughing tenderness which persuaded you of the sweetness of his
disposition. No man who had those blue eyes could bear to hurt any one

amid the banter which was the staple of their conversation he insinuated
every now and then a pretty, flattering speech.

He danced rottenly, he was a wet blanket at a party, he couldn’t play or sing, he
couldn’t play polo and his tennis was no better than anybody else’s. 

He had pestered her into marrying him and now she was fed up.

He came into the room: Her heart was beating wildly and her hands were
shaking; it was lucky that she lay on the sofa. She was holding an open book
as though she had been reading. He stood for an instant on the threshold and
their eyes met. Her heart sank; she felt on a sudden a cold chill pass through
her limbs and she shivered. She had that feeling which you describe by
saying that some one was walking over your grave. His face was deathly
pale; she had seen it like that once before, when they sat together in the Park
and he asked her to marry him. His dark eyes, immobile and inscrutable,
seemed pretematurally large. He knew everything

The bungalow stood half way down a steep hill and from her window she
saw the narrow river below her and opposite, the city. The dawn had just
broken and from the river rose a white mist shrouding the junks that lay
moored close to one another like peas in a pod. There were hundreds of them,
and they were silent, mysterious in that ghostly light, and you had a feeling
that their crews lay under an enchantment, for it seemed that it was not sleep,
but something strange and terrible, that held them so still and mute.

clasped
her hands clasped to her breast and her mouth

For some days she did not stir from the bungalow. It was
very hot and for the most part she lay in a long chair by the open window,
trying to read. The hard light of midday had robbed the magic palace of its
mystery and now it was no more than a temple on the city wall, garish and
shabby, but because she had seen it once in such an ecstasy it was never
again quite common-place; and often at dawn or at dusk, and again at night,
she found herself able to recapture something of that beauty. What had
seemed to her a mighty bastion was but the city wall and on this, massive and
dark, her eyes rested continually. Behind its crenellations lay the city in the
dread grip of the pestilence

Vaguely she knew that terrible things were happening there, not from
Walter who when she questioned him (for otherwise he rarely spoke to her)
answered with a humorous nonchalance which sent a shiver down her spine;
but from Waddington and from the amah. The people were dying at the rate
of a hundred a day, and hardly any of those who were attacked by the disease
recovered from it; the gods had been brought out from the abandoned temples
and placed in the streets; offerings were laid before them and sacrifices made,
but they did not stay the plague. The people died so fast that it was hardly
possible to bury them. In some houses the whole family had been swept away
and there was none to perform the funeral rights. The officer commanding the
troops was a masterful man and if the city was not given over to riot and
arson it was due to his determination. He forced his soldiers to bury such as
there was no one else to bury and he had shot with his own hand an officer
who demurred at entering a stricken house.

The narrow causeway meandered sinuously among the green rice-fields.
A small boy seated on the neck of a water-buffalo drove it slowly
home, and three peasants in wide straw hats lolloped with sidelong gait under
their heavy loads. After the heat of the day it was pleasant in that spot to
catch the faint breeze of the evening and the wide expanse of country brought
a sense of restful melancholy to the tortured heart. But Kitty could not rid her
mind of the dead beggar.

The street was narrow and winding so that Kitty lost all sense of the
direction in which she was going. Many of the shops were closed. She had
grown used on the journey up to the untidiness of a Chinese street, but here
was the litter of weeks, garbage and refuse; and the stench was so horrible
that she had to put her handkerchief to her face.
Passing through Chinese
cities she had been incommoded by the staring of the crowd, but now she
noticed that no more than an indifferent glance was thrown at her.
The passers-by, scattered rather than as usual thronging, seemed intent on their
own affairs. They were cowed and listless. Now and then as they went by a
house they heard the beating of gongs and the shrill, sustained lament of
unknown instruments. Behind those closed doors one was lying dead.

She was a woman of middle age, she might have been forty or fifty, it was impossible to
say, for there were few wrinkles on her smooth, pale face, and you received
the impression that she was far from young chiefly from the dignity of her
bearing, her assurance, and the emaciation of her strong and beautiful hands.
The face was long, with a large mouth and large, even teeth; the nose, though
not small, was delicate and sensitive; but it was the eyes, under their thin
black brows, which gave her face its intense and tragic character. 
They were very large, black, and though not exactly cold, by their calm steadiness
strangely compelling.

the city to see about her the wide country.

One of these days the monks would wander away from the
shady, pleasant wood, and the buildings, crumbling and neglected, would be
battered by fierce storms and besieged by the surrounding nature. Wild
creepers would twine themselves about the dead images and the trees would
grow in the courtyards. Then the gods would dwell there no longer, but evil
spirits of darkness.

sluggish
watched the river flow sluggish and with many a bend towards the stricken city.

melancholy feeling of the transitoriness of things

But the river, though it flowed so slowly, had still a sense of movement and it gave one a melancholy
feeling of the transitoriness of things. Everything passed, and what trace of its
passage remained? It seemed to Kitty that they were all, the human race, like
the drops of water in that river and they flowed on, each so close to the other
and yet so far apart, a nameless flood, to the sea. When all things lasted so
short a time and nothing mattered very much, it seemed pitiful that men,
attaching an absurd importance to trivial objects, should make themselves
and one another so unhappy.

She had an instinct to throw herself on the mercy of his humour. After all
they had gone through, when they were living amid these scenes of horror
and desolation, it seemed inept to attach importance to the ridiculous act of
fornication.  When death stood round the comer, taking lives like a gardener
digging up potatoes, it was foolishness to care what dirty things this person or
that did with his body. If she could only make him realise how little Charlie
meant to her, so that now already she had difficulty in calling up his features
to her imagination, and how entirely the love of him had passed out of her
heart! Because she had no feeling for Townsend the various acts she had
committed with him had lost their significance. She had regained her heart
and what she had given of her body seemed not to matter a rap. She was
inclined to say to Walter: ‘Look here, don’t you think we’ve been silly long
enough? We’ve sulked with one another like children. Why can’t we kiss and
be friends. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t be friends just because we’re
not lovers.’

Kitty shook hands with her. She was slim in her long embroidered gown
and somewhat taller than Kitty, used to the Southern people, had expected.
She wore a jacket of pale green silk with tight sleeves that came over her
wrists and on her black hair, elaborately dressed, was the head-dress of the
Manchu women. Her face was coated with powder and her cheeks from the
eyes to the mouth heavily rouged; her plucked eyebrows were a thin dark line
and her mouth was scarlet. From this mask her black, slightly slanting, large
eyes burned like lakes of liquid jet. She seemed more like an idol than a
woman. Her movements were slow and assured. Kitty had the impression that
she was slightly shy but very curious. She nodded her head two or three
times, looking at Kitty, while Waddington spoke of her. Kitty noticed her
hands; they were preternaturally long, very slender, of the colour of ivory;
and the exquisite nails were painted. Kitty thought she had never seen
anything so lovely as those languid and elegant hands. They suggested the
breeding of uncounted centuries.

When this was translated to the Manchu she gave Kitty a quick glance in
which there was the hint of a smile. She was impressive as she sat, without
embarrassment, in her beautiful clothes; and from the painted face the eyes
looked out wary, self-possessed and unfathomable. She was unreal, like a
picture, and yet had an elegance which made Kitty feel all thumbs. Kitty had
never paid anything but passing and somewhat contemptuous attention to the
China in which fate had thrown her. It was not done in her set. Now she
seemed on a sudden to have an inkling of something remote and mysterious.
Here was the East, immemorial, dark and inscrutable. The beliefs and the
ideals of the West seemed crude beside ideals and beliefs of which in this
exquisite creature she seemed to catch a fugitive glimpse. Here was a
different life, lived on a different plane. Kitty felt strangely that the sight of
this idol, with her painted face and slanting, wary eyes, made the efforts and
the pains of the everyday world she knew slightly absurd. That coloured
mask seemed to hide the secret of an abundant profound and significant
experience: those long, delicate hands with their tapering fingers held the key
of riddles undivined.

Dawn was breaking now, and here and there a Chinese was taking down

was washing her hands and face. In a tea-house at a corner a group of men
were eating an early meal. The grey, cold light of the rising day sidled along
the narrow lanes like a thief. There was a pale mist on the river and the masts
of the crowded junks loomed through it like the lances of a phantom army. It
was chilly as they crossed and Kitty huddled herself up in her gay and
coloured shawl. They walked up the hill and they were above the mist. The
sun shone from an unclouded sky. It shone as though this were a day like
another and nothing had happened to distinguish it from its fellows.

It was singular, when she reflected how

merely a nuisance. How strange was the relation between parents and
children! When they were small the parents doted on them, passed through
agonies of apprehension at each childish ailment, and the children clung to
their parents with love and adoration; a few years passed, the children grew
up, and persons not of their kin were more important to their happiness than
father or mother. Indifference displaced the blind and instinctive love of the
past. Their meetings were a source of boredom and irritation. Distracted once
at the thought of a month’s separation they were able now to look forward
with equanimity to being parted for years. Her mother need not worry: as
soon as she could she would make herself a home of her own. But she must
have a little time; at present everything was vague and she could not form
any picture of the future: perhaps she would die in childbirth; that would be a
solution of many difficulties.
