Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that.

In England, Simon was irritated by the persecution of
those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more
liberal brethren

thence |ðens|

Mindful of John Wesley's
strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling, Simon
made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit he was unhappy
lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory of
God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel.

mindful |ˈmaɪndfl|
stricture |ˈstrɪktʃə(r)|

So Simon, having
forgotten his teacher's dictum on the possession of human chattels,
bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on
the banks of the Alabama River some forty miles above Saint
Stephens. 

dictum |ˈdɪktəm|

chattel /ˈtʃætl/

He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find a wife, and
with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to
an impressive age and died rich.

impotent |ˈɪmpətənt|

Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance
between the North and the South, as it left his descendants stripped of
everything but their land, 
yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century, when my
father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his younger
brother went to Boston to study medicine.

When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and
began his practice.


Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finch's Landing, was the county seat of Maycomb County

escape with their lives

The Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb's leading blacksmith
in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, 
were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses, 
and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-coming-to-him
was a good enough defense for anybody.

blacksmith |ˈblæksmɪθ|
imprudent |ɪmˈpru:dnt|
dispatch |dɪˈspætʃ|
detention |dɪˈtenʃn|

They persisted in pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, 
so there was nothing much Atticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure, 
an occasion that was probably the beginning of my father's profound distaste 
for the practice of criminal law

distaste |dɪsˈteɪst|


slop |slɒp; 美 slɑ:p|

spinach |ˈspɪnɪtʃ; -ɪdʒ|

Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer's day; 
bony mules  hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square.

Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. 
Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps,
and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.

Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been
studied and found acceptable.

strange longings, and quaint fancies.

The Radleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a
predilection unforgivable in Maycomb.They did not go to church,
Maycomb's principal recreation, but worshiped at home;

According to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was
in his teens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from
Old Sarum, an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern
part of the county, and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever
seen in Maycomb.

One night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed
around the square in a borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by
Maycomb's ancient beadle, Mr. Conner, and locked him in the
courthouse outhouse.

spurt |spɜ:t; 美 spɜ:rt|
flivver

The town decided something had to be done; Mr. Conner said
he knew who each and every one of them was, and he was bound and
determined they wouldn't get away with it, so the boys came before the
probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the
peace, assault and battery, and using abusive and profane language
in the presence and hearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner
why he included the last charge; Mr. Conner said they cussed so loud
he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard them.

bound and determined       -very determined to do sth

disgrace |dɪsˈgreɪs|

If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley
would see to it that Arthur gave no further trouble. Knowing that
Mr. Radley's word was his bond, the judge was glad to do so.

Boo drove the
scissors into his parent's leg, pulled them out, wiped them on his
pants, and resumed his activities.

Boo's transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in
Jem's memory. 

nebulous |ˈnebjələs|

mold /məʊld/
bounty |ˈbaʊnti|

intimidate |ɪnˈtɪmɪdeɪt|

Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep
Boo out of sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained
to the bed most of the time.

employ - to use sth such as a skill, method, etc. for a particular purpose


Miss Stephanie Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as
his only law, and we believed her, because Mr. Radley's posture was ramrod straight.

ramrod |ˈræmrɒd; 美 -rɑ:d|

He goes out, all right, when it's pitch dark.

gravel |ˈgrævl|

Boo was about
six-and-a-half feet tall, judging from his tracks; he dined on raw
squirrels and any cats he could catch, that's why his hands were
bloodstained- if you ate an animal raw, you could never wash the blood
off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face; what teeth
he had were yellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most of
the time.

Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet Jem The Gray
Ghost against two Tom Swifts that Jem wouldn't get any farther than
the Radley gate. In all his life, Jem had never declined a dare.
Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more
than his head, for Dill wore him down easily

raid |reɪd|

Jem said he reckoned he wasn't

Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house, slapped
it with his palm and ran back past us, not waiting to see if his foray
was successful. Dill and I followed on his heels. Safely on our porch,
panting and out of breath, we looked back.

The old house was the same, droopy and sick, but as we stared down
the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move. Flick. A tiny,
almost invisible movement, and the house was still.

Hours of wintertime had
found me in the treehouse, looking over at the schoolyard, spying on
multitudes of children through a two-power telescope Jem had given me,
learning their games, following Jem's red jacket through wriggling
circles of blind man's buff, secretly sharing their misfortunes and
minor victories. I longed to join them.

She boarded across the street one door
down from us in Miss Maudie Atkinson's upstairs front room, and
when Miss Maudie introduced us to her, Jem was in a haze for days.

The class murmured apprehensively, should she prove to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous to that region.

Miss Caroline seemed unaware that the ragged, denim-shirted and
floursack-skirted first grade, most of whom had chopped cotton and fed
hogs from the time they were able to walk, were immune to
imaginative literature.

imaginative |ɪˈmædʒɪnətɪv|


as I read the alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrows, and 
after making me read most of My First Reader and the stock-market quotations from The Mobile Register aloud, 
she discovered that I was literate and 
looked at me with more than faint distaste. 
Miss Caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, 
it would interfere with my reading.

alphabet |ˈælfəbet|

literate |ˈlɪtərət|
quotation |kwəʊˈteɪʃn; 美 kwoʊ-|

I mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime.
I never deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing
illicitly in the daily papers. 
mumble |ˈmʌmbl|

meditate |ˈmedɪteɪt|

wallow |ˈwɒləʊ; 美 ˈwɑ:loʊ|

Now that I was compelled to think about it, reading was something that
just came to me, as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit
without looking around, or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces

bow |bəʊ; 美 boʊ|
snarl |snɑ:l; 美 snɑ:rl|
shoelace |ˈʃu:leɪs|

I knew I had annoyed Miss Caroline, so I let well enough alone and
stared out the window until recess when Jem cut me from the covey of
first-graders in the schoolyard. He asked how I was getting along. I
told him. 
recess |rɪˈses; ˈri:ses|

Having never questioned Jem's pronouncements, I saw no reason to
begin now.

No comment seemed to be expected of us, and the

I turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus
delegation looking at me. Miss Caroline and I had conferred twice
already, and they were looking at me in the innocent assurance that
familiarity breeds understanding.

One morning Jem and I found a load of stovewood in the
back yard. Later, a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps.

The Cunninghams are country folks, farmers, and the
crash hit them hardest.

As Maycomb County was farm country, nickels and
dimes were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers.
Entailment was only a part of Mr. Cunningham's vexations.

The acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt, 
and the little cash he made went to interest.

Mr.Cunningham, said Atticus, came from a set breed of men.

He charges some folks a bushel of potatoes for
delivery of a baby.

If I could have explained these things to Miss Caroline, I would
have saved myself some inconvenience and Miss Caroline
subsequent mortification,
but it was beyond my ability to explain things as
well as Atticus

When Miss Caroline threatened it with a similar fate 
the first grade exploded again, 
becoming cold sober only when the shadow of Miss Blount fell over them. 
Miss Blount, a native Maycombian as yet
uninitiated in the mysteries of the Decimal System, appeared at the
door hands on hips and announced

Walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to
Jem and me. His fists were half cocked, as if expecting an onslaught
from both of us.

stomp |stɒmp; 美 stɑ:mp|

Walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food: his eyes, as
blue as Dill Harris's, were red-rimmed and watery. There was no
color in his face except at the tip of his nose, which was moistly
pink. He fingered the straps of his overalls, nervously picking at the
metal hooks.

Atticus summoned Calpurnia, who
returned bearing the syrup pitcher.

summon |ˈsʌmən|
syrup |ˈsɪrəp|

pitcher |ˈpɪtʃə(r)|

The silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher, and he
quickly put his hands in his lap. Then he ducked his head. 

saucer |ˈsɔ:sə(r)|
clatter |ˈklætə(r)|


duck |dʌk|


It was then that Calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen.
She was furious, and when she was furious 
Calpurnia's grammar became erratic. 
When in tranquility, her grammar was as good as anybody's
in Maycomb. Atticus said Calpurnia had more education than most
colored folks. 

grammar |ˈgræmə(r)|

Calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a
stinging smack. I retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the
kitchen, thankful, though, that I was spared the humiliation of facing
them again.

Jem and Walter returned to school ahead of me: 
staying behind to advise Atticus of Calpurnia's iniquities 
was worth a solitary sprint past the Radley Place.

I returned to school and hated Calpurnia steadily until a sudden

Atticus said I had learned many things today, and Miss Caroline
had learned several things herself. She had learned not to hand
something to a Cunningham, for one thing, but if Walter and I had
put ourselves in her shoes we'd have seen it was an honest mistake
on her part. We could not expect her to learn all Maycomb's ways in
one day, and we could not hold her responsible when she knew no better.

As for me, I knew nothing except what I gathered

examined my loot. The gum looked fresh. I sniffed it and it smelled

Until it happened I did not realize that Jem was offended by my
contradicting him on Hot Steams, and that he was patiently awaiting an
opportunity to reward me. He did, by pushing the tire down the
sidewalk with all the force in his body. 
Ground, sky and houses melted into a mad palette, my ears throbbed, I was suffocating.
I could not put out my hands to stop, they were wedged between my chest and knees.
I could only hope that Jem would outrun the tire and me, or that I
would be stopped by a bump in the sidewalk. I heard him behind me,
chasing and shouting.

The tire bumped on gravel, skeetered across the road, crashed into a
barrier and popped me like a cork onto pavement. Dizzy and
nauseated, I lay on the cement and shook my head still, pounded my
ears to silence, and heard Jem's voice: "Scout, get away from there,
come on!"

Jem looked at me furiously, could not decline, ran down the

the tire.

Jem's head at times was transparent: he had thought that up to
make me understand he wasn't afraid of Radleys in any shape or form,
to contrast his own fearless heroism with my cowardice.

Besides, I don't think he's still there. He died years ago and 
they stuffed him up the chimney.

I was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldn't prove it, 
and felt it best to keep my mouth shut or 
I would be accused of believing in Hot Steams, phenomena I was immune to in the daytime.

As the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected
it, added dialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play
upon which we rang changes every day.

I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I
played that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem's
assurances that Boo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with
him and Calpurnia there in the daytime and Atticus home at night.
Jem was a born hero.

I was the probate judge, for a change; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, 
poking him with the brushbroom. Jem would reappear as
needed in the shapes of the sheriff, assorted townsfolk, and Miss
Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the Radleys than
anybody in Maycomb.

I was not so sure, but Jem told me I was being a girl, that girls always imagined things, 
that's why other people hated them so, 
and if I started behaving like one I could just go off 
and find some to play with.

My nagging got the better of Jem eventually, as I knew it would(get the better of Jem), and
to my relief we slowed down the game for a while. He still maintained,
however, that Atticus hadn't said we couldn't, therefore we could; and
if Atticus ever said we couldn't, Jem had thought of a way around
it: he would simply change the names of the characters and then we
couldn't be accused of playing anything.

Dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action. Dill was
becoming something of a trial anyway, following Jem about.

He had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him, then he promptly forgot
about it. He staked me out, marked as his property, said I was the
only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me. I beat him up
twice but it did no good, he only grew closer to Jem. They spent
days together in the treehouse plotting and planning, calling me
only when they needed a third party.

I spent most of the remaining twilights that summer sitting with
Miss Maudie Atkinson on her front porch.

Until Jem and Dill excluded me from their plans, she was only
another lady in the neighborhood, but a relatively benign presence.

Our tacit treaty with Miss Maudie was that we could play on her
lawn, eat her scuppernongs if we didn't jump on the arbor, and explore
her vast back lot, terms so generous we seldom spoke to her, so
careful were we to preserve the delicate balance of our
relationship, but Jem and Dill drove me closer to her with their
behavior.

She loved everything that grew in God's earth, even the weeds.
With one exception. If she found a blade of nut grass in her yard it
was like the Second Battle of the Marne: she swooped down upon it with
a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous
substance she said was so powerful it'd kill us all if we didn't stand
out of the way.

In summertime, twilights are long and peaceful. Often as not, Miss
Maudie and I would sit silently on her porch, watching the sky go from

Jem and I thought this a strange way to
ask for a lady's hand in marriage, but then Uncle Jack was rather strange.
He said he was trying to get Miss Maudie's goat, that he
had been trying unsuccessfully for forty years, that he was the last
person in the world Miss Maudie would think about marrying but the
first person she thought about teasing, and the best defense to her
was spirited offense, all of which we understood clearly.

My confidence in pulpit Gospel lessened at the vision of Miss Maudie
stewing forever in various Protestant hells. 
True enough, she had an acid tongue in her head, and 
she did not go about the neighborhood doing good, as did Miss Stephanie Crawford. 
But while no one with a grain of sense trusted Miss Stephanie, 
Jem and I had considerable faith in Miss Maudie.

you."

A gigantic moon was rising behind Miss Maudie's pecan trees. 
"That makes it seem hotter," he said.
"Cross in it tonight?" asked Dill, not looking up.

He pointed across the street. At first we saw nothing but a
kudzu-covered front porch, but a closer inspection revealed an arc
of water descending from the leaves and splashing in the yellow circle
of the street light, some ten feet from source to earth, it seemed to us.

splash |splæʃ|

Jem said Mr. Avery misfigured, Dill said he must drink a gallon
a day, and the ensuing contest to determine relative distances and
respective prowess only made me feel left out again, as I was
untalented in this area.

contest |ˈkɒntest; 美 ˈkɑ:n-|

Dill stretched, yawned,and said altogether too casually. "I know
what, let's go for a walk."

Jem said, "Okay." When I protested, he said sweetly, "You don't have to come along, Angel May." 

protest |ˈprəʊtest; 美 ˈproʊ-|

Jem was not one to dwell on past defeats: it seemed the only message
he got from Atticus was insight into the art of cross examination.

We strolled silently down the sidewalk, listening to porch swings
creaking with the weight of the neighborhood, listening to the soft
night-murmurs of the grown people on our street.

We thought it was better to go under the high wire fence at the rear of the Radley lot, 
we stood less chance of being seen.The fence enclosed a large
garden and a narrow wooden outhouse.

there were two doors and two dark windows between the doors. 
Instead of a column, a rough two-by-four supported one end of the roof.

That we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was
confirmed when Dill ahead of us spelled G-o-d in a whisper.

he warned me, as I was about to protest.

Then I saw the shadow. It was the shadow of a man with a hat on.
At first I thought it was a tree, but there was no wind blowing, and
tree-trunks never walked. The back porch was bathed in moonlight,
and the shadow, crisp as toast, moved across the porch toward Jem.
 Dill saw it next. He put his hands to his face.

Jem leaped off the porch and galloped toward us. He flung open the
gate, danced Dill and me through, and shooed us between two rows of 
swishing collards. Halfway through the collards I tripped; as I
tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered the neighborhood.

In the glare from the streetlight, I could see Dill hatching one:
his eyes widened, his fat cherub face grew rounder.

I admired my brother. Matches were dangerous, but cards were fatal.

trot |trɒt; 美 trɑ:t|

bawl |bɔ:l|
cot |kɒt; 美 kɑ:t|


Had Jem's pants been safely on him, we would not have slept much
anyway. Every night-sound I heard from my cot on the back porch was
magnified three-fold; every scratch of feet on gravel was Boo Radley
seeking revenge, every passing Negro laughing in the night was Boo
Radley loose and after us; insects splashing against the screen were 
Boo Radley's insane fingers picking the wire to pieces; the chinaberry
trees were malignant, hovering, alive. I lingered between sleep and
wakefulness until I heard Jem murmur.

In the waning moonlight I saw Jem swing his feet to the floor.

I began to feel sick. Going back to that place by himself- I
remembered Miss Stephanie: Mr. Nathan had the other barrel waiting for
the next sound he heard, be it nigger, dog... Jem knew that better than I.

Jem's white shirt-tail dipped and bobbed like a small

A faint breeze stirred and cooled the sweat running down my sides.

I waited for his light to go on, straining my eyes to see it flood the hall.
It stayed off, and I breathed again.



The night-crawlers had retired, but ripe chinaberries drummed on the
roof when the wind stirred, and the darkness was desolate with the  barking of distant dogs.

drum |drʌm|

desolate |ˈdesələt|


102
bob |bɒb; 美 bɑ:b|
moody |ˈmu:di|

Jem stayed moody and silent for a week. As Atticus had once
advised me to do, I tried to climb into Jem's skin and walk around
in it: if I had gone alone to the Radley Place at two in the
morning, my funeral would have been held the next afternoon. So I left
Jem alone and tried not to bother him.

Miss Caroline's progress next door could be estimated by the
frequency of laughter; however, the usual crew had flunked the first
grade again, and were helpful in keeping order.

The second grade was grim, but Jem assured me that 
the older I got the better school would be, that he started off the same way, and it
was not until one reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of
value.
二年级的时光很糟糕，但杰姆向我保证，我年龄越大，学校生活就会越好，

He declared Egyptians walked
that way; I said if they did I didn't see how they got anything
done, but Jem said they accomplished more than the Americans ever did,
they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming, and asked where
would we be today if they hadn't?

Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and I'd have the facts.

I pulled out two small images carved in
soap. One was the figure of a boy, the other wore a crude dress.

shriek |ʃri:k|

snatch |snætʃ|


They were almost perfect miniatures of
two children. The boy had on shorts, and a shock of soapy hair fell to
his eyebrows. I looked up at Jem. A point of straight brown hair
kicked downwards from his part. I had never noticed it before.
Jem looked from the girl-doll to me. The girl-doll wore bangs. So
did I.

Less than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum,
which we enjoyed, the fact that everything on the Radley Place was
poison having slipped Jem's memory.

When the new wore off his grandfather's watch, and carrying it
became a day's burdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of
ascertaining the hour every five minutes.

Next day Jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded. 

vigil |ˈvɪdʒɪl|

Jem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we
passed our tree he gave it a meditative pat on its cement, and
remained deep in thought. He seemed to be working himself into a bad
humor, so I kept my distance.
meditative |ˈmedɪtətɪv; 美 -teɪt-|

Jem leaned on a pillar, rubbing his shoulders against it. 
"Do you itch, Jem?

He stood there until nightfall, and I waited for him. When we went
in the house I saw he had been crying; his face was dirty in the right
places, but I thought it odd that I had not heard him.

For reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in
Maycomb County, autumn turned to winter that year.

Jem and I were burdened with the guilt of contributing
to the aberrations of nature, thereby causing unhappiness to our
neighbors and discomfort to ourselves. 

杰姆和我背负着这样的内疚感，觉得是我们促成了大自然的异常现象，从而给邻居们带来了苦恼，也让我们自己感到不安。

aberration |ˌæbəˈreɪʃn|

Jem restrained me from further questions. He said Atticus was
still touchy about us and the Radleys and it wouldn't do to push him
any.
Jem had a notion that Atticus thought our activities that night
last summer were not solely confined to strip poker. Jem had no firm
basis for his ideas, he said it was merely a twitch.

Eula May was Maycomb's leading telephone operator. She was entrusted with issuing public announcements, 
wedding invitations, setting off the fire siren, and giving first-aid instructions when Dr. Reynolds was away. 


announcement |əˈnaʊnsmənt|

When Atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our
plates instead of out the windows, Jem asked, "How do you make a
snowman?"

Calpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking. When we
ran to the back yard, it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy
snow. 

bid  |bɪd|
-to tell sb to do sth 告诉（某人做某事）；吩咐


feeble |ˈfi:bl|

stick |stɪk|
soggy |ˈsɒgi; 美 ˈsɑ:gi|



I looked back at my mushy footprints. Jem said if we waited until it
snowed some more we could scrape it all up for a snowman. I stuck
out my tongue and caught a fat flake. It burned. 

mushy |ˈmʌʃi|
scrape |skreɪp|

Jem hopped across the front yard. I followed in his tracks. When
we were on the sidewalk in front of Miss Maudie's, Mr. Avery
accosted us. He had a pink face and a big stomach below his belt.

I wondered if Mr. Avery knew how hopefully we had watched last
summer for him to repeat his performance, and reflected that if this
was our reward, there was something to say for sin.
I did not wonder where Mr. Avery gathered his meteorological statistics: they came
straight from the Rosetta Stone.

Miss Maudie's old sunhat glistened with snow crystals.She was
bending over some small bushes, wrapping them in burlap bags. Jem
asked her what she was doing that for.

"You'll see," he said. "Now get the basket and haul all the snow you
can rake up from the back yard to the front. Walk back in your tracks,
though," he cautioned.
“你等着瞧吧，” 他说，“现在去拿个篮子，把你能从后院耙起来的雪都运到前院来。不过，要踩着你走过的脚印往回走。” 他提醒道。

though |ðəʊ; 美 ðoʊ|


Jem ran to the back yard, produced the garden hoe and began
digging quickly behind the woodpile, placing any worms he found to
one side. He went in the house, returned with the laundry hamper, filled
it with earth and carried it to the front yard. 
杰姆跑到后院，拿来了园艺锄头，然后迅速在柴堆后面挖起来，把挖到的蚯蚓都放到一旁。他走进屋里，拿了洗衣篮出来，把篮子装满泥土，接着把它搬到了前院。

Jem scooped up an armful of dirt, patted it into a mound on which he
added another load, and another until he had constructed a torso.

them, and bent them into bones to be covered with dirt. 

procure |prəˈkjʊə(r); 美 -ˈkjʊr|
switch |swɪtʃ|

plait |plæt|


Jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more dirt. 
He looked thoughtfully at it for a moment, then he molded a
big stomach below the figure's waistline. Jem glanced at me, his
eyes twinkling: "Mr. Avery's sort of shaped like a snowman, ain't he?"
Jem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on. He permitted me
to cover only the back, saving the public parts for himself. Gradually
Mr. Avery turned white. 

slosh |slɒʃ; 美 slɑ:ʃ|
mud |mʌd|

waistline |ˈweɪstlaɪn|
plaster |ˈplɑ:stə(r); 美 ˈplæs-|


Using bits of wood for eyes, nose, mouth, and buttons, Jem succeeded
in making Mr. Avery look cross. A stick of stovewood completed the
picture. Jem stepped back and viewed his creation. 

cross |krɒs; 美 krɔ:s| adj. annoyed or quite angry 


Jem's ears reddened from Atticus's compliment, but he looked up
sharply when he saw Atticus stepping back. Atticus squinted at the
snowman a while.
He grinned, then laughed. "Son, I can't tell what
you're going to be an engineer, a lawyer, or a portrait painter.
You've perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard. We've got to
disguise this fellow."

Atticus suggested that Jem hone down his creation's front a
little, swap a broom for the stovewood, and put an apron on him.
Jem explained that if he did, the snowman would become muddy and
cease to be a snowman.

Before I went to sleep Atticus put more coal on the fire in my room. 
He said the thermometer registered sixteen, that it was the coldest
night in his memory, and that our snowman outside was frozen solid.

Soft taffeta-like sounds and muffled scurrying sounds filled me with
helpless dread.

At the front door, we saw fire spewing from Miss Maudie's diningroom
windows. As if to confirm what we saw, the town fire siren wailed up
the scale to a treble pitch and remained there, screaming

The old fire truck, killed by the cold, was being pushed
from town by a crowd of men. When the men attached its hose to a
hydrant, the hose burst and water shot up, tinkling down on the
pavement.

from men on top of the adjacent houses, beating out sparks and burning
chunks of wood.

"You can just take that back, boy!"
This order, given by me to Cecil Jacobs, was the beginning of a
rather thin time for Jem and me. My fists were clenched and I was
ready to let fly. Atticus had promised me he would wear me out if he
ever heard of me fighting any more; I was far too old and too big
for such childish things, and the sooner I learned to hold in, the
better off everybody would be. I soon forgot. 

Cecil Jacobs made me forget. He had announced in the schoolyard
the day before that Scout Finch's daddy defended niggers. I denied it,
but told Jem.

"For a number of reasons," said Atticus. "The main one is, if I
didn't I couldn't hold up my head in town, I couldn't represent this
county in the legislature, I couldn't even tell you or Jem not to do
something again."

Somehow, if I fought Cecil I would let Atticus down. 
Atticus so rarely asked Jem and me to do something for him, I could take being
called a coward for him. I felt extremely noble for having remembered,
and remained noble for three weeks. Then Christmas came and disaster struck.

I suppose I should include Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Alexandra's husband,
but as he never spoke a word to me in my life except to say, "Get
off the fence," once, I never saw any reason to take notice of him.
Neither did Aunt Alexandra. Long ago, in a burst of friendliness,
Aunty and Uncle Jimmy produced a son named Henry, who left home
as soon as was humanly possible, married, and produced Francis. 
Henry and his wife deposited Francis at his grandparents' every Christmas,
then pursued their own pleasures.

No amount of sighing could induce Atticus to let us spend  Christmas day at home.
We went to Finch's Landing every Christmas in my memory. 
The fact that Aunty was a good cook was some compensation for being forced to spend a religious holiday with Francis Hancock.

Aunt Alexandra was Atticus's sister, but when Jem told me about
changelings and siblings, I decided that she had been swapped at
birth, that my grandparents had perhaps received a Crawford instead of
a Finch. Had I ever harbored the mystical notions about mountains that
seem to obsess lawyers and judges, Aunt Alexandra would have been
analogous to Mount Everest: throughout my early life, she was cold and
there.

One Christmas I lurked in corners nursing a twisted splinter
in my foot, permitting no one to come near me.
When Uncle Jack caught me, he kept me laughing about a preacher who hated going to
church so much that every day he stood at his gate in his
dressing-gown, smoking a hookah and delivering five-minute sermons
to any passers-by who desired spiritual comfort.
I interrupted to make Uncle Jack let me know when he would pull it out, but he held up a
bloody splinter in a pair of tweezers and said he yanked it while I
was laughing, that was what was known as relativity.

Finch's Landing consisted of three hundred and sixty-six steps

farm equipment, and feminine apparel.

A two-rut road ran from the riverside and vanished among dark trees.

In his old age, our ancestor Simon Finch had built it to
please his nagging wife; but with the porches all resemblance to
ordinary houses of its era ended.The internal arrangements of the
Finch house were indicative of Simon's guilelessness and the
absolute trust with which he regarded his offspring.

There were six bedrooms upstairs, four for the eight female
children, one for Welcome Finch, the sole son, and one for visiting
relatives. Simple enough; but the daughters' rooms could be reached
only by one staircase, Welcome's room and the guestroom only by
another. 
The Daughters' Staircase was in the ground-floor bedroom of
their parents, so Simon always knew the hours of his daughters'
nocturnal comings and goings.

There was a kitchen separate from the rest of the house, tacked onto
it by a wooden catwalk;in the back yard was a rusty bell on a pole,
used to summon field hands or as a distress signal; a widow's walk was
on the roof, but no widows walked there- from it, Simon oversaw his
overseer, watched the river-boats, and gazed into the lives of
surrounding landholders.

He was the most boring child I ever met. As he lived in Mobile, 
he could not inform on me to school authorities,
but he managed to tell everything he knew to Aunt Alexandra, who in
turn unburdened herself to Atticus, who either forgot it or gave me
hell, whichever struck his fancy.

But the only time (when) I ever heard Atticus speak sharply to anyone was

I suggested that one could be a ray of sunshine in pants just as well, 
but Aunty said that one had to behave like a sunbeam, that I was born good but had grown
progressively worse every year.She hurt my feelings and set my
teeth permanently on edge, but when I asked Atticus about it, he
said there were already enough sunbeams in the family and to go on
about my business, he didn't mind me much the way I was.

Aunty had continued to isolate me long after Jem and Francis graduated to the

Atticus reached the porch, Jem opened the door.

I thought mad dogs foamed at the mouth, galloped, leaped and
lunged at throats, and I thought they did it in August.
Had Tim Johnson behaved thus, I would have been less frightened.

I saw Miss Stephanie Crawford's face framed in the glass window of her front door.

Atticus put his foot on the rung of a chair and 
rubbed his hand slowly down the side of his thigh.

Tim Johnson came into sight, walking dazedly in the inner rim of the
curve parallel to the Radley house.

 Tim Johnson was advancing at a snail's pace, but he was not
playing or sniffing at foliage: he seemed dedicated to one course
and motivated by an invisible force that was inching him toward us. We
could see him shiver like a horse shedding flies; his jaw opened and
shut; he was alist, but he was being pulled gradually toward us.

With movements so swift they seemed simultaneous, Atticus's hand
yanked a ball-tipped lever as he brought the gun to his shoulder.

The rifle cracked. Tim Johnson leaped, flopped over and crumpled
on the sidewalk in a brown-and-white heap. He didn't know what hit him.

It was impossible to go to town without
passing her house unless we wished to walk a mile out of the way.
Previous minor encounters with her left me with no desire for more,
but Jem said I had to grow up some time.
如果不路过她的房子，就不可能进城，除非我们愿意多绕一英里的路。
之前与她的几次小接触让我一点儿也不想再和她打交道了，但杰姆说我总有一天得长大。

Jem and I hated her. If she was on the porch when we passed, we
would be raked by her wrathful gaze, subjected to ruthless
interrogation regarding our behavior, and given a melancholy
prediction on what we would amount to when we grew up, which
was always nothing. 


rake |reɪk|

如果我们路过时她在门廊上，我们就会被她愤怒的目光扫视，遭受她对我们行为毫不留情的质问，还会被她做出关于我们长大后会有何成就的悲观预言，而那预言向来是说我们将来一事无成。

We had long ago given up the idea of walking past
her house on the opposite side of the street; that only made her raise
her voice and let the whole neighborhood in on it.

Besides being the sassiest, most disrespectful mutts who ever passed her way, 
we were told that it was quite a pity our father had not remarried after our mother's death.
A lovelier lady than our mother never lived, she said, and it
was heartbreaking the way Atticus Finch let her children run wild.

I never heard Atticus say like a picture of what. He would tell
her the courthouse news, and would say he hoped with all his heart
she'd have a good day tomorrow. He would return his hat to his head,
swing me to his shoulders in her very presence, and we would go home
in the twilight. It was times like these when I thought my father, who
hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who
ever lived.


courthouse |ˈkɔ:thaʊs; 美 ˈkɔ:rt-|


The day after Jem's twelfth birthday his money was burning up his
pockets, so we headed for town in the early afternoon. Jem thought
he had enough to buy a miniature steam engine for himself and a
twirling baton for me.

If you aren't sent to the reform school before next week, my name's not Dubose!

Jem, who hadn't been near Miss Maudie's scuppernong arbor since last
summer, and who knew Miss Maudie wouldn't tell Atticus if he had,
issued a general denial.

I wasn't sure what Jem resented most, but I took umbrage at Mrs.
Dubose's assessment of the family's mental hygiene. I had become
almost accustomed to hearing insults aimed at Atticus. But this was
the first one coming from an adult. Except for her remarks about
Atticus, Mrs. Dubose's attack was only routine. There was a hint of
summer in the air- in the shadows it was cool, but the sun was warm,
which meant good times coming: no school and Dill.

In later years, I sometimes wondered exactly what made Jem do it,
what made him break the bonds of "You just be a gentleman, son," and
the phase of self-conscious rectitude he had recently entered. 

rectitude |ˈrektɪtju:d; 美 -tu:d|


Jem had probably stood as much guff about Atticus lawing for niggers as had I,
and I took it for granted that he kept his temper-he had a
naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse. 

as much...as

What Jem did was something I'd do as a matter of course had I not
been under Atticus's interdict, which I assumed included not
fighting horrible old ladies.
杰姆所做的事情，要是我没有受到阿蒂克斯的禁令约束的话，我也会理所当然地去做。
我认为（阿蒂克斯的禁令）包括不能和可恶的老太太打架这一点。

We had just come to her gate when Jem
snatched my baton and ran flailing wildly up the steps into Mrs.
Dubose's front yard, forgetting everything Atticus had said,
forgetting that she packed a pistol under her shawls, forgetting
that if Mrs. Dubose missed, her girl Jessie probably wouldn't.

He did not begin to calm down until he had cut the tops off every
camellia bush Mrs. Dubose owned, until the ground was littered with
green buds and leaves. He bent my baton against his knee, snapped it
in two and threw it down.

The following Monday afternoon Jem and I climbed the steep front
steps to Mrs. Dubose's house and padded down the open hallway
pad |pæd|

An oppressive odor met us when we crossed the threshold, an odor I
had met many times in rain-rotted gray houses where there are coal-oil
lamps, water dippers, and unbleached domestic sheets. It always made
me afraid, expectant, watchful.

She was horrible. Her face was the color of a dirty pillowcase,
and the corners of her mouth glistened with wet, which inched like a
glacier down the deep grooves enclosing her chin. Old-age liver
spots dotted her cheeks, and her pale eyes had black pinpoint
pupils. Her hands were knobby, and the cuticles were grown up over her
fingernails. Her bottom plate was not in, and her upper lip protruded;
from time to time she would draw her nether lip to her upper plate and
carry her chin with it. This made the wet move faster.

had acquired an alien set of values and was trying to impose them on me

But summer came and Dill was not there. I received a letter and a snapshot from him. 
The letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed, 
and he would have to stay in Meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat. 
His father was a lawyer like Atticus, only much younger. 
Dill's new father had a pleasant face, which made me glad Dill had captured him, 
but I was crushed. Dill concluded by saying he would love me forever and not to worry, 
he would come get me and marry me as soon as he got enough money together, so please write.

The fact that I had a permanent fiance was little compensation for his absence
I had never thought about it, but summer was Dill by the fishpool smoking string, 
Dill's eyes alive with complicated plans to make Boo Radley emerge; 
summer was the swiftness with which Dill would reach up and kiss me when Jem was not looking, 
the longings we sometimes felt each other feel.
With him, life was routine; without him, life was unbearable. I stayed miserable for two days. 


As if that were not enough, the state legislature was called into
emergency session and Atticus left us for two weeks. The Governor
was eager to scrape a few barnacles off the ship of state（州长急于清除国家这艘大船上的一些积弊）; there
were sit-down strikes in Birmingham; bread lines in the cities grew
longer, people in the country grew poorer. But these were events
remote from the world of Jem and me.

If Calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before, it was nothing
compared to her supervision of that Saturday night's routine. She made
me soap all over twice, drew fresh water in the tub for each rinse;
she stuck my head in the basin and washed it with Octagon soap and
castile. She had trusted Jem for years, but that night she invaded his
privacy and provoked an outburst: "Can't anybody take a bath in this
house without the whole family looking?"

 Calpurnia's hands went to our shoulders and we stopped and looked
around: standing in the path behind us was a tall Negro woman. Her
weight was on one leg; she rested her left elbow in the curve of her
hip, pointing at us with upturned palm. She was bullet-headed with
strange almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and an Indian-bow mouth.
She seemed seven feet high. 

hip |hɪp|
almond |ˈɑ:mənd|

contemptuous |kənˈtemptʃuəs|

indignant |ɪnˈdɪgnənt|
indignantly

 they did not want us here. I sensed, rather than saw, that
we were being advanced upon. They seemed to be drawing closer to us,
but when I looked up at Calpurnia there was amusement in her eyes.
When I looked down the pathway again, Lula was gone. In her place
was a solid mass of colored people.

She fished in her purse, drew out her
handkerchief, and untied the hard wad of change in its corner. She
gave a dime to me and a dime to Jem.

noun -钱包，皮夹子（尤指女用的）

wad |wɒd; 美 wɑ:d|
-a thick pile of pieces of paper, paper money, etc. folded or rolled together （纸张、钞票等的）卷，沓，捆


Jem's face showed brief indecision on the ethics of withholding his own dime, but
his innate courtesy won and he shifted his dime to his pocket. I did
likewise with no qualms.

I turned to Calpurnia but was hushed before I opened my mouth.
Subdued, I fixed my attention upon Reverend Sykes, 
who seemed to be waiting for me to settle down.

Miraculously on pitch, a hundred voices sang out Zeebo's words.
The last syllable, held to a husky hum, was followed by Zeebo saying

Line for line, voices followed in simple harmony until the hymn ended in a melancholy murmur.

His sermon was a forthright denunciation of sin, an austere
declaration of the motto on the wall behind him: he warned his flock
against the evils of heady brews, gambling, and strange women.
Bootleggers caused enough trouble in the Quarters, but women were
worse. Again, as I had often met it in my own church, I was confronted
with the Impurity of Women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen.

One by one, the congregation came forward and dropped nickels and dimes into a black enameled coffee can. 
Jem and I followed suit, and received a soft, "Thank you, thank you," as
our dimes clinked.

If people follow suit, they do the same thing that someone else has just done.

The church was becoming stuffy, and it occurred to me that
Reverend Sykes intended to sweat the amount due out of his flock.
Fans crackled, feet shuffled, tobacco-chewers were in agony.

I was bursting with questions, but decided I would wait and let Calpurnia answer them.
“I” 是主语，“was bursting with” 是谓语动词短语，“questions” 是宾语；
“but” 是并列连词；“decided” 是谓语动词，
后面 “ I would wait and let Calpurnia answer them” 是省略了 that 的宾语从句，
“I” 是从句主语，“would wait and let” 是从句谓语部分，“Calpurnia” 是宾语，“answer them” 是宾语补足语。

commentary |ˈkɒməntri; 美 ˈkɑ:mənteri|



That Calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me. The idea
that she had a separate existence outside our household was a novel
one, to say nothing of her having command of two languages.

I looked down the street. Enarmored, upright, uncompromising, Aunt
Alexandra was sitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat
there every day of her life.

"Well, your father and I decided it was time I came to stay with you

"For a while" in Maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty
years. Jem and I exchanged glances.

tactful |ˈtæktfl|
sluggish |ˈslʌgɪʃ|
irritable |ˈɪrɪtəbl|
corset |ˈkɔ:sɪt; 美 ˈkɔ:rsɪt|


I guess it was her Sunday corset. She was
not fat, but solid, and she chose protective garments that drew up her
bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her waist, flared out her rear, and
managed to suggest that Aunt Alexandra's was once an hour-glass
figure. From any angle, it was formidable.

The remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that
descends when relatives appear, but was dispelled when we heard a
car turn in the driveway.

dignity |ˈdɪgnəti|

"How'd you like for her to come live with us?"
I said I would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must
lie under certain circumstances and at all times when one can't do
anything about them. 





refreshment |rɪˈfreʃmənt|
secretary |ˈsekrətri; 美 -teri|

To all parties present and participating in the life of the county, Aunt Alexandra was one of the last of her kind


she was born in the objective case; she was an incurable gossip

She was never bored, and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative: she would arrange, advise, caution, and warn.

Aunty better watch how she talks—scratch most folks in Maycomb and they're kin to us.

Aunt Alexandra, in underlining the moral of young Sam Merriweather's suicide, said it was caused by a morbid streak in the family.

morbid |ˈmɔ:bɪd; 美 ˈmɔ:rbɪd|

227

Everybody in Maycomb, it seemed, had a Streak: a Drinking Streak, a

I never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had
received the impression that Fine Folks were people who did the best
they could with the sense they had, but Aunt Alexandra was of the
opinion, obliquely expressed, that the longer a family had been
squatting on one patch of land the finer it was.

Because its primary reason for existence was government, Maycomb was spared the grubbiness that distinguished most Alabama towns its size.
In the beginning its buildings were solid, its courthouse proud, its streets graciously wide.

Maycomb's proportion of professional people ran high:

As a result the town remained the same size for a hundred years, an island in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland.

New people so rarely settled there, the same families
married the same families until the members of the community looked
faintly alike. Occasionally someone would return from Montgomery or
Mobile with an outsider, but the result caused only a ripple in the
quiet stream of family resemblance. Things were more or less the
same during my early years. 




ripple |ˈrɪpl|

glove, but never into the world of Jem and me.

These were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay, as
she had little to say to Jem or me, and we saw her only at mealtimes
and at night before we went to bed. It was summer and we were
outdoors. Of course some afternoons when I would run inside for a
drink of water, I would find the livingroom overrun with Maycomb
ladies, sipping, whispering, fanning, and I would be called: "Jean
Louise, come speak to these ladies."

but he looked the same.

Atticus crossed his knees and folded his arms. "I'm trying to tell

Jem's disgust deepened. "I know all that stuff," he said. 


Atticus paused, watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg.

As Jem and I stared, the door opened again and Atticus peered around.
His eyebrows were raised, his glasses had slipped. "Get more like Cousin Joshua every day, don't I? Do you think I'll end up costing the family five hundred dollars?"

rape |reɪp|


oligarchy |ˈɒlɪgɑ:ki; 美 ˈɑ:ləgɑ:rki|




"What's rape?" I asked him that night. 
He sighed, and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force
and without consent. 

 "Well if that's all it is why did Calpurnia dry me up when I asked
her what it was?" 


carnal |ˈkɑ:nl; 美 ˈkɑ:rnl|

pensive |ˈpensɪv|

but Aunt Alexandra, who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing, put down her embroidery and stared at us.

embroidery |ɪmˈbrɔɪdəri|

"You may not." 
Aunt Alexandra said it. I wheeled around, startled, then turned back
to Atticus in time to catch his swift glance at her, but it was too
late. I said, "I didn't ask you!" 

startle |ˈstɑ:tl; 美 ˈstɑ:rtl|

I understood, pondered a while, and concluded that the only way I
could retire with a shred of dignity was to go to the bathroom,
where I stayed long enough to make them think I had to go.

Besides, sister, I don't want you working your head off for us- you've no reason to do that. We still need Cal as much as we ever did.

 He slapped me and I tried another left, but a

the breath out of me, but it didn't matter because I knew he was
fighting, he was fighting me back. We were still equals.

"Ain't so high and mighty now, are you!" I screamed, sailing in
again. He was still on the bed and I couldn't get a firm stance, so
I threw myself at him as hard as I could, hitting, pulling,
pinching, gouging. What had begun as a fist-fight became a brawl. We
were still struggling when Atticus separated us.

I noticed not without satisfaction that the mark of my knuckles was still on his mouth.

Miss Rachel Haverford's excuse for a glass of neat whiskey every morning was that 
she never got over the fright of finding a rattler coiled in her bedroom closet, 
on her washing, when she went to hang up her negligee.

raised the broom and missed Dill's head by an inch when it appeared.

We watched Dill emerge by degrees. He was a tight fit. He stood up
and eased his shoulders, turned his feet in their ankle sockets,
rubbed the back of his neck. His circulation restored, he said, "Hey." 
Jem petitioned God again. I was speechless. 
"I'm 'bout to perish," said Dill. "Got anything to eat?"

Dill devoured it, chewing with his front teeth, as was his custom. 

devour |dɪˈvaʊə(r)|

I finally found my voice. "How'd you get here?" 
By an involved route. Refreshed by food, Dill recited this narrative：
having been bound in chains and left to die in the basement
(there were basements in Meridian) by his new father, who disliked
him, and secretly kept alive on raw field peas by a passing farmer who
heard his cries for help (the good man poked a bushel pod by pod
through the ventilator), Dill worked himself free by pulling the
chains from the wall. Still in wrist manacles, he wandered two miles
out of Meridian where he discovered a small animal show and was
immediately engaged to wash the camel. He traveled with the show all
over Mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he
was in Abbott County, Alabama, just across the river from Maycomb.
He walked the rest of the way.

"How'd you get here?" asked Jem. 
He had taken thirteen dollars from his mother's purse, 
caught the nine o'clock from Meridian and got off at Maycomb Junction. He had
walked ten or eleven of the fourteen miles to Maycomb, off the highway
in the scrub bushes lest the authorities be seeking him, and had
ridden the remainder of the way clinging to the backboard of a
cotton wagon. He had been under the bed for two hours, he thought;
he had heard us in the diningroom, and the clink of forks on plates
nearly drove him crazy. He thought Jem and I would never go to bed; he
had considered emerging and helping me beat Jem, as Jem had grown
far taller, but he knew Mr. Finch would break it up soon, so he
thought it best to stay where he was. He was worn out, dirty beyond
belief, and home.

Dill's eyes flickered at Jem, and Jem looked at the floor. Then he
rose and broke the remaining code of our childhood. He went out of the
room and down the hall. "Atticus," his voice was distant, "can you
come here a minute, sir?" 

flicker |ˈflɪkə(r)|

Beneath its sweat-streaked dirt Dill's face went white. I felt sick.

Since things appeared to have worked out pretty well, Dill and I
decided to be civil to Jem. Besides, Dill had to sleep with him so
we might as well speak to him. 
I put on my pajamas, read for a while and found myself suddenly
unable to keep my eyes open. Dill and Jem were quiet; when I turned
off my reading lamp there was no strip of light under the door to
Jem's room.

"Didn't you all build that boat like you wrote you were gonna?"
"He just said we would. We never did."

I pushed the pillow to the headboard and sat up.

"You know something? I was fixing to run off tonight because there they all
were. You don't want them around you all the time, Dill" 

run off

"Atticus's gone all day and sometimes half the night
and off in the legislature and I don't know what- you don't want 'em
around all the time, Dill, you couldn't do anything if they were." 


As Dill explained, I found myself wondering what life would be if
Jem were different, even from what he was now; what I would do if
Atticus did not feel the necessity of my presence, help and advice.
Why, he couldn't get along a day without me. Even Calpurnia couldn't
get along unless I was there. They needed me. 
“听迪尔说着，我不禁琢磨起来：要是杰姆变得不一样了，哪怕和现在不一样，生活会是什么样呢？”

"Scout, let's get us a baby."

"Where?" 

There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed
across to a foggy island where all these babies were; you could order one.

"That's a lie. Aunty said God drops 'em down the chimney. At least
that's what I think she said." For once, Aunty's diction had not been too clear. 

"Well that ain't so. You get babies from each other. But there's
this man, too- he has all these babies just waitin' to wake up, he
breathes life into 'em...."

Dill was off again. Beautiful things floated around in his dreamy head. 
He could read two books to my one, but he preferred the magic of his own inventions. 
He could add and subtract faster than lightning, but he preferred his own twilight world, 
a world where babies slept, waiting to be gathered like morning lilies. 
He was slowly talking himself to sleep and taking me with him, but in the quietness of his
foggy island there rose the faded image of a gray house with sad brown doors. 

"Dill?"

"Mm?"

"Why do you reckon Boo Radley's never run off?"

Dill sighed a long sigh and turned away from me.

"Maybe he doesn't have anywhere to run off to...."

Jem saw that he would have to fight me to keep me home, and I

The south side of the square was deserted. Giant monkey-puzzle
bushes bristled on each corner, and between them an iron hitching rail
glistened under the street lights. A light shone in the county toilet,
otherwise that side of the courthouse was dark. A larger square of
stores surrounded the courthouse square; 
dim lights burned from deep within them.

Mr. Underwood not only ran The Maycomb Tribune office, he lived in
it. That is, above it. He covered the courthouse and jailhouse news
simply by looking out his upstairs window. The office building was
on the northwest corner of the square, and to reach it we had to
pass the jail.

- to report on an event for television, a newspaper, etc.; to show an event on television 报道；电视报道

The Maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the
county's buildings. Atticus said it was like something Cousin Joshua
St. Clair might have designed. It was certainly someone's dream.
Starkly out of place in a town of square-faced stores and steep-roofed
houses, the Maycomb jail was a miniature Gothic joke one cell wide and
two cells high, complete with tiny battlements and flying
buttresses. Its fantasy was heightened by its red brick facade and the
thick steel bars at its ecclesiastical windows. It stood on no
lonely hill, but was wedged between Tyndal's Hardware Store and The
Maycomb Tribune office. The jail was Maycomb's only conversation
piece: its detractors said it looked like a Victorian privy; its
supporters said it gave the town a good solid respectable look, and no
stranger would ever suspect that it was full of niggers.

I was getting a bit tired of that, but felt Jem had his own reasons for doing as he did,
in view of his prospects once Atticus did get him home.（考虑到一旦阿迪克斯把他带回家后的前景）

 I looked around the crowd. It was a summer's night,
but the men were dressed, most of them, in overalls and denim shirts
buttoned up to the collars. I thought they must be cold-natured, as
their sleeves were unrolled and buttoned at the cuffs. Some wore
hats pulled firmly down over their ears. They were sullen-looking,
sleepy-eyed men who seemed unused to late hours. I sought once more
for a familiar face, and at the center of the semi-circle I found one.

Mr. Cunningham wore no hat, and the top half of his forehead was

that he wore one most days. He shifted his feet, clad in heavy work shoes.

 Atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about
what they were interested in, not about what you were interested in. 
Mr. Cunningham displayed no interest in his son, so I tackled his

I began to feel sweat gathering at the edges of my hair;
I could stand anything but a bunch of people looking at me. They were quite still.

"What's the matter?" I asked. 

Atticus said nothing. I looked around and up at Mr. Cunningham,
whose face was equally impassive. Then he did a peculiar thing. He
squatted down and took me by both shoulders.

Walking toward the office, Dill and I fell into step behind
Atticus and Jem. Dill was encumbered by the chair, and his pace was
slower. Atticus and Jem were well ahead of us, and I assumed that
Atticus was giving him hell for not going home, but I was wrong. As
they passed under a streetlight, Atticus reached out and massaged
Jem's hair, his one gesture of affection.

 Jem heard me. He thrust his head around the connecting door. As he
came to my bed Atticus's light flashed on. We stayed where we were
until it went off; we heard him turn over, and we waited until he
was still again. 

thrust |θrʌst|


We had come in quietly, so as not to wake Aunty.Atticus killed
the engine in the driveway and coasted to the carhouse; we went in the
back door and to our rooms without a word. I was very tired, and was
drifting into sleep when the memory of Atticus calmly folding his
newspaper and pushing back his hat became Atticus standing in the
middle of an empty waiting street, pushing up his glasses. The full
meaning of the night's events hit me and I began crying. 

coast |kəʊst; 美 koʊst| verb



Jem was awfully nice about it: for once he didn't remind me that people nearly nine years old didn't do things like that.

Local opinion held Mr. Underwood to be an intense, profane little
man, whose father in a fey fit of humor christened Braxton Bragg, a

Calpurnia was serving Aunt Alexandra more coffee, 
and she shook her head at what I thought was a pleading winning look.

"You're still too little," she said. "I'll tell you when you ain't."

I said it might help my stomach.

"All right," she said,

She poured one tablespoonful of coffee into it and filled the cup to the brim with milk.

I thanked her by sticking out my tongue at it, 
and looked up to catch Aunty's warning frown. 
But she was frowning at Atticus.




I was beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these days,
that came out when he talked with Aunt Alexandra. It was a quiet
digging in, never outright irritation. There was a faint starchiness
in his voice when he said, "Anything fit to say at the table's fit
to say in front of Calpurnia. She knows what she means to this
family."

The courthouse square was covered with picnic
parties sitting on newspapers, washing down biscuit and syrup with
warm milk from fruit jars.

Some people were gnawing on cold chicken

 Some invisible signal had made the lunchers on the square rise and
scatter bits of newspaper, cellophane, and wrapping paper. Children
came to mothers, babies were cradled on hips as men in sweat-stained
hats collected their families and herded them through the courthouse
doors. In the far corner of the square the Negroes and Mr. Dolphus
Raymond stood up and dusted their breeches. There were few women
and children among them, which seemed to dispel the holiday mood. They
waited patiently at the doors behind the white families.

The Maycomb County courthouse was faintly reminiscent of Arlington
in one respect: the concrete pillars supporting its south roof were
too heavy for their light burden. 
The pillars were all that remained standing when the original courthouse burned in 1856. 

Another courthouse was built around them. It is better to say, built in spite of them. 

But for the south porch, the Maycomb County courthouse was early Victorian, 
presenting an unoffensive vista when seen from the north. 

From the other side, however, Greek revival columns clashed with a big nineteenth-century clock tower 
housing  a rusty unreliable instrument, 
a view indicating a people determined to preserve every physical scrap of the past. 
[然而，从另一面看，希腊复兴风格的柱子与一座 19 世纪的大钟楼格格不入 —— 钟楼里装着一台锈迹斑斑、走时不准的钟表。这一景象暗示着此地民众决意保存过去的每一丝物质痕迹。]

the tax assessor, the tax collector, the county clerk, the county solicitor, the circuit clerk, 
the judge of probate lived in cool dim hutches that smelled of decaying record
books mingled with old damp cement and stale urine. It was necessary
to turn on the lights in the daytime; there was always a film of
dust on the rough floorboards. The inhabitants of these offices were
creatures of their environment: little gray-faced men, they seemed
untouched by wind or sun.

 We knew there was a crowd, but we had not bargained for the
multitudes in the first-floor hallway. I got separated from Jem and
Dill, but made my way toward the wall by the stairwell, knowing Jem
would come for me eventually. I found myself in the middle of the
Idlers' Club and made myself as unobtrusive as possible. This was a
group of white-shirted, khaki-trousered, suspendered old men who had
spent their lives doing nothing and passed their twilight days doing
same on pine benches under the live oaks on the square.

Attentive critics of courthouse business, Atticus said they knew as much law
as the Chief Justice, from long years of observation. Normally, they
were the court's only spectators, and today they seemed resentful of
the interruption of their comfortable routine. When they spoke,
their voices sounded casually important.

This was news, news that put a different light on things: Atticus
had to, whether he wanted to or not. I thought it odd that he hadn't
said anything to us about it-we could have used it many times in
defending him and ourselves. He had to, that's why he was doing it,
equaled fewer fights and less fussing. But did that explain the town's
attitude? The court appointed Atticus to defend him. Atticus aimed
to defend him. That's what they didn't like about it. It was
confusing.

The club began its stiff-jointed climb and ran into Dill and Jem

Only[倒装结构] once was Judge Taylor ever seen at a dead
standstill in open court, and the Cunninghams stopped him.
Old Sarum, their stamping grounds, was populated by two families

but unfortunately bearing the same name.

The Cunninghams married the Coninghams until the spelling

During a controversy of this character, Jeems Cunningham testified that his mother
spelled it Cunningham on deeds and things, but she was really a
Coningham, she was an uncertain speller, a seldom reader, 
and was given to looking far away sometimes when she sat on the front
gallery in the evening. After nine hours of listening to the
eccentricities of Old Sarum's inhabitants, Judge Taylor threw the case
out of court.

 Judge Taylor had one interesting habit. He permitted smoking in
his courtroom but did not himself indulge: sometimes, if one was
lucky, one had the privilege of watching him put a long dry cigar into
his mouth and munch it slowly up. Bit by bit the dead cigar would
disappear, to reappear some hours later as a flat slick mess, its
essence extracted and mingling with Judge Taylor's digestive juices.

Mr. Tate had dressed for the occasion. He wore an ordinary
business suit, which made him look somehow like every other man:
[倒装结构]gone were his high boots, lumber jacket, and bullet-studded belt. 
From that moment he ceased to terrify me. He was sitting forward in the
witness chair, his hands clasped between his knees, listening
attentively to the circuit solicitor.

solicitor |səˈlɪsɪtə(r)|

The solicitor, a Mr. Gilmer, was not well known to us. He was from
Abbottsville; we saw him only when court convened, and that rarely,
for court was of no special interest to Jem and me. A balding,
smooth-faced man, he could have been anywhere between forty and sixty.

Although his back was to us, we knew he had a slight cast in one of
his eyes which he used to his advantage: he seemed to be looking at
a person when he was actually doing nothing of the kind, thus he was
hell on juries and witnesses. 

The jury, thinking themselves under
close scrutiny, paid attention; so did the witnesses, thinking
likewise.[陪审团以为自己正被严密审视，于是集中注意力；证人也是如此，抱着同样的想法。]

Atticus walked to the court reporter's desk and bent down to
the furiously scribbling hand. It stopped, flipped back the

 Atticus seemed to be bordering on another question, but he thought
better of it and said, "Yes, what were her other injuries?"
As Mr. Tate answered, Atticus turned and looked at Tom Robinson as if to
say this was something they hadn't bargained for.

Atticus sat down and nodded to the circuit solicitor, who shook
his head at the judge, who nodded to Mr. Tate, who rose stiffly and
stepped down from the witness stand[从证人席下来].

Below us, heads turned, feet scraped the floor, babies were

Dill was asking Reverend Sykes what it was all about, but Reverend
Sykes said he didn't know. So far, things were utterly dull: nobody
had thundered, there were no arguments between opposing counsel,
there was no drama; a grave disappointment to all present, it seemed.
Atticus was proceeding amiably, as if he were involved in a title dispute.

Gone was the terror in my mind of stale whiskey and barnyard smells,

All the spectators were as relaxed as Judge Taylor, except Jem.
His mouth was twisted into a purposeful half-grin, and his eyes

Maycomb's Ewells lived behind the town garbage dump in what was once a Negro cabin.

The cabin's plank walls were supplemented with sheets
of corrugated iron, its roof shingled with tin cans hammered flat,
so only its general shape suggested its original design: square,
with four tiny rooms opening onto a shotgun hall, the cabin rested
uneasily upon four irregular lumps of limestone. Its windows were
merely open spaces in the walls, which in the summertime were
covered with greasy strips of cheesecloth to keep out the varmints
that feasted on Maycomb's refuse.

The varmints had a lean time of it, for the Ewells gave the dump a thorough gleaning every day, 
and the fruits of their industry (those that were not eaten) 
made the plot of ground around the cabin look like the playhouse of an insane child:
 
what passed for a fence was bits of tree-limbs, broomsticks and tool shafts, all tipped with rusty
hammer-heads, snaggle-toothed rake heads, shovels, axes and grubbing
hoes, held on with pieces of barbed wire. 

Enclosed by this barricade was a dirty yard containing the remains of a Model-T Ford (on blocks),
a discarded dentist's chair, an ancient icebox, plus lesser items: 
old shoes, worn-out table radios, picture frames, and fruit jars, 
under which scrawny orange chickens pecked hopefully.

One corner of the yard, though, bewildered Maycomb.

Nobody was quite sure how many children were on the place. 
Some people said six, others said nine; there were always several
dirty-faced ones at the windows when anyone passed by. 

Nobody had occasion to pass by except at Christmas, when the churches delivered baskets, 
and when the mayor of Maycomb asked us to please help the garbage collector by dumping our own trees and trash.

Atticus took us with him last Christmas when he complied with the mayor's request.
[去年圣诞节，阿蒂克斯在遵从市长的请求时带上了我们。]


A dirt road ran from the highway past the dump,
down to a small Negro settlement some five hundred yards beyond the
Ewells'. It was necessary either to back out to the highway or go
the full length of the road and turn around; most people turned around
in the Negroes' front yards. In the frosty December dusk, their cabins
looked neat and snug with pale blue smoke rising from the chimneys and
doorways glowing amber from the fires inside. There were delicious
smells about: chicken, bacon frying crisp as the twilight air. Jem and
I detected squirrel cooking, but it took an old countryman like 
Atticus to identify possum and rabbit, aromas that vanished when we
rode back past the Ewell residence.

Mr. Gilmer's back stiffened a little, and I felt sorry for him.

Perhaps I'd better explain something now. I've heard that lawyers'
children, on seeing their parents in court in the heat of argument,
get the wrong idea: they think opposing counsel to be the personal
enemies of their parents, they suffer agonies, and are surprised to
see them often go out arm-in-arm with their tormenters during the
first recess.  This was not true of Jem and me.
We acquired no traumas from watching our father win or lose. 

I'm sorry that I can't provide any drama in this respect; if I did, it would not be true.

We could tell, however, when debate became more acrimonious than professional, 
but this was from watching lawyers other than our father. 

I never heard Atticus raise his voice in my life, except to a deaf witness. 
Mr. Gilmer was doing his job, as Atticus was doing his. 
Besides, Mr. Ewell was Mr. Gilmer's witness, 
and he had no business being rude to him of all people. 
[况且，尤厄尔先生是吉尔默先生的证人，他尤其不该对这个人无礼。]

"This the first time you've ever been in court? I don't recall ever seeing you here."

We often wondered who else's words Mr. Gilmer was afraid his witness might employ.

[倒装结构]So serene was Judge Taylor's court, that he had few occasions to use
his gavel, but he hammered fully five minutes. Atticus was on his feet
at the bench saying something to him, Mr. Heck Tate as first officer
of the county stood in the middle aisle quelling the packed courtroom.
Behind us, there was an angry muffled groan from the colored people.

"You gotta make me first," I said, remembering Atticus's blessed dictum.[You've got to make me first]

As Judge Taylor banged his gavel, Mr. Ewell was sitting smugly in
the witness chair, surveying his handiwork. 

With one phrase 
he had turned happy picknickers into a sulky, tense, murmuring crowd, 
being slowly hypnotized by gavel taps lessening in intensity until the
only sound in the courtroom was a dim pink-pink-pink: 

the judge might have been rapping the bench with a pencil.

"There has been a request," Judge Taylor said, "that this
courtroom be cleared of spectators, or at least of women and children,
a request that will be denied for the time being. "
[泰勒法官说：“有人请求清空法庭旁观者，或至少让妇女儿童离场，这一请求目前将被驳回]


People generally see what they look for, 
and hear what they listen for, 
and they have the right to subject their children to it,

but I can assure you of one thing: 
you will receive what you see and hear in silence or you will leave this courtroom,

but you won't leave it until the whole boiling
of you come before me on contempt charges. 

Mr. Ewell, you will keep
your testimony within the confines of Christian English usage, if that
is possible. Proceed, Mr. Gilmer."

I was sure he had never heard the words 
Judge Taylor directed at him - his mouth struggled
silently with them - but their import registered on his face.

Smugness faded from it, replaced by a dogged earnestness that fooled
Judge Taylor not at all: as long as Mr. Ewell was on the stand, the
judge kept his eyes on him, as if daring him to make a false move.

 Mr. Gilmer and Atticus exchanged glances. Atticus was sitting down
again, his fist rested on his cheek and we could not see his face. Mr.
Gilmer looked rather desperate.

The little man seemed to have forgotten his previous humiliation
from the bench. It was becoming evident that he thought Atticus an
easy match. He seemed to grow ruddy again; his chest swelled, and once
more he was a red little rooster.

I was becoming nervous. 
Atticus seemed to know what he was doing 
but it seemed to me that he'd gone frog-sticking without a light.

[倒装句]Never, never, never, on cross-examination ask a witness a question you

 Atticus was reaching into the inside pocket of his coat. He drew out
an envelope, then reached into his vest pocket and unclipped his fountain pen. 

He moved leisurely, and had turned so that he was in

gently on his table.

"You're left-handed, Mr. Ewell," said Judge Taylor.
Mr. Ewell turned angrily to the judge and said he didn't see what his being left-handed had to do with it, 
that he was a Christ-fearing man and Atticus Finch was taking advantage of him.
[尤厄尔先生愤怒地转向法官，称他不明白自己是左撇子与本案有何关联]

Tricking lawyers like Atticus Finch took advantage of him all the time with their tricking ways.

Mr. Ewell had a scalded look; 
as if an overnight soaking had deprived him of protective layers
of dirt, his skin appeared to be sensitive to the elements. Mayella
looked as if she tried to keep clean, and I was reminded of the row of

Slowly but surely I began to see the pattern of Atticus's questions:
from questions that Mr. Gilmer did not deem sufficiently irrelevant or

jury a picture of the Ewells' home life.

the weather was seldom cold enough to require shoes, but when it was,
you could make dandy ones from strips of old tires; 

the family hauled its water in buckets from a spring that ran out at one end of
the dump - they kept the surrounding area clear of trash - and it was
everybody for himself as far as keeping clean went: 
[这家人用桶从垃圾场一端的泉眼里打水 —— 他们把周围的地方清理得没有垃圾 —— 而说到保持干净，每个人都只能靠自己]

if you wanted to wash you hauled your own water; the younger children had perpetual
colds and suffered from chronic ground-itch; 
there was a lady who came around sometimes and asked Mayella why she didn't stay in school
she wrote down the answer; with two members of the family reading
and writing, there was no need for the rest of them to learn 
Papa needed them at home.

Jem turned back to Dill, explaining, 
I suppose, the finer points of the trial to him, but I wondered what they were.

There had been no lengthy debates between Atticus and Mr.
Gilmer on any points; 
Mr. Gilmer seemed to be prosecuting almost reluctantly;

witnesses had been led by the nose as asses are, with few
objections. 

But Atticus had once told us that in Judge Taylor's
court any lawyer who was a strict constructionist on evidence
usually wound up receiving strict instructions from the bench.

He distilled this for me to mean that Judge Taylor might look lazy and
operate in his sleep,

 Judge Taylor looked daggers at Atticus, as if daring him to speak,
but Atticus had ducked his head and was laughing into his lap. I
remembered something he had said about Judge Taylor's ex cathedra
remarks sometimes exceeding his duty, but that few lawyers ever did
anything about them.

I knew that Mr. Gilmer would sincerely tell the jury that 
anyone who was convicted of disorderly conduct could easily have had it in his
heart to take advantage of Mayella Ewell, that was the only reason he cared. 
Reasons like that helped.

This was as much as I heard of Mr. Gilmer's cross-examination,
because Jem made me take Dill out. For some reason Dill had started
crying and couldn't stop; quietly at first, then his sobs were heard
by several people in the balcony. Jem said if I didn't go with him
he'd make me, and Reverend Sykes said I'd better go, so I went. 
Dill had seemed to be all right that day, nothing wrong with him, but I
guessed he hadn't fully recovered from running away. 



Dill tried to pull himself together as we ran down the south steps

He peered around the trunk at us.



"Here," he said, offering Dill his paper sack with straws in it.
"Take a good sip, it'll quieten you."

"Cry about what, Mr. Raymond?" Dill's maleness was beginning to assert itself.

Atticus was speaking easily, with the kind
of detachment he used when he dictated a letter. He walked slowly up
and down in front of the jury, and the jury seemed to be attentive:
their heads were up, and they followed Atticus's route with what
seemed to be appreciation.

Atticus put his hands in his pockets, and as he returned to the
jury, I saw his gold collar button and the tips of his pen and
pencil winking in the light. 


collar |ˈkɒlə(r); 美 ˈkɑ:l-|


"Gentlemen," he said. Jem and I again looked at each other:
Atticus might have said, "Scout." His voice had lost its aridity,
its detachment, and he was talking to the jury as if they were folks
on the post office corner.

I have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state, 
but my pity does not extend so far as to her putting a man's life at stake, 
which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt.

stake |steɪk|


360 

She has committed no crime, she has merely broken a rigid and
time-honored code of our society, 
a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with. 


rigid |ˈrɪdʒɪd|
code |kəʊd; 美 koʊd| noun
-密码；暗码；电码；代码
- 道德准则；行为规范

midst |mɪdst|


She is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance, but I cannot pity her: she is
white. She knew full well the enormity of her offense, but because her
desires were stronger than the code she was breaking, she persisted in
breaking it. She persisted, and her subsequent reaction is something
that all of us have known at one time or another. She did something
every child has done- she tried to put the evidence of her offense
away from her. 

But in this case she was no child hiding stolen
contraband: she struck out at her victim- of necessity she must put
him away from her- he must be removed from her presence, from this
world. She must destroy the evidence of her offense. 

cruel |kru:əl|

And so a quiet, respectable, humble Negro 
(who had the unmitigated temerity  to 'feel sorry' for a white woman )
has had to put his word against two white people's.
I need not remind you of their appearance and conduct on the stand,
you saw them for yourselves.

The witnesses for the state, with the exception of the sheriff of
Maycomb County, have presented themselves to you gentlemen, to this
court, in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted, 
confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on
the assumption - the evil assumption- that all Negroes lie, that
all Negroes are basically immoral beings, that all Negro men are
not to be trusted around our women, 
an assumption one associates with minds of their caliber

All men are created equal.

The most ridiculous example I can think of is that the people who
run public education promote the stupid and idle along with the industrious,

because all men are created equal, educators will gravely
tell you, the children left behind suffer terrible feelings of inferiority.

idle |ˈaɪdl|

industrious |ɪnˈdʌstriəs|

inferiority |ɪnˌfɪəriˈɒrəti; 美 -ˌfɪriˈɔ:r-; -ˈɑ:r-|

We know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe,
some people are smarter than others,
some people have more opportunity because they're born with it, 
some men make more money than others, 
some ladies make better cakes than others,
some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men. 

But there is one way in this country in which all men are created equal,
there is one human institution 
that makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, 
the stupid man the equal of an Einstein, 
and the ignorant man the equal of any college president. 
That institution, gentlemen, is a court. 
It can be the Supreme Court of the United States or 
the humblest J.P. court in the land, or 
this honorable court which you serve. 
Our courts have their faults, as does any human institution, 
but in this country our courts are the great levelers,
and in our courts all men are created equal.

I'm no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts
and in the jury system that is no ideal to me, it is a living, working reality. 

Gentlemen, a court is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury. 
A court is only as sound as its jury, 
and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up. 
I am confident that you will review without passion the
evidence you have heard, come to a decision, 
and restore this defendant to his family.

I was exhilarated. So many things had happened so fast I felt it

fighting sleep, I allowed myself a short nap against Reverend
Sykes's comfortable arm and shoulder.

past |pɑ:st; 美 pæst| prep.

I jerked awake and made an honest effort to remain so,
by looking down and concentrating on the heads below.
there were sixteen bald ones, fourteen men that could
pass for redheads, forty heads varying between brown and black, and 
I remembered something Jem had once explained to me when he went
through a brief period of psychical research.

he said if enough people- a stadium full, maybe-  were to concentrate on one thing,

"Ain't it a long time?" I asked him.
"Sure is, Scout," he said happily.
"Well, from the way you put it, it'd just take five minutes." 
 
Jem raised his eyebrows. "There are things you don't understand," he
said, and I was too weary to argue. 

Isn't it a long time? 
Is it a long time?

weary |ˈwɪəri; 美 ˈwɪri|

But I must have been reasonably awake, or I would not have
received the impression that was creeping into me.
It was not unlike one I had last winter, and I shivered, though the night was hot. The
feeling grew until the atmosphere in the courtroom was exactly the
same as a cold February morning, when the mockingbirds were still, and
the carpenters had stopped hammering on Miss Maudie's new house, and
every wood door in the neighborhood was shut as tight as the doors
of the Radley Place.

A deserted, waiting, empty street, and the courtroom was packed with people. 
A steaming summer night was no different from a winter morning. 

steaming |ˈsti:mɪŋ| adj.




Mr. Heck Tate, who had entered the
courtroom and was talking to Atticus, might have been wearing his high
boots and lumber jacket. Atticus had stopped his tranquil journey
and had put his foot onto the bottom rung of a chair; as he listened
to what Mr. Tate was saying, he ran his hand slowly up and down his
thigh. I expected Mr. Tate to say any minute, "Take him, Mr.
Finch...."

in a kitchen chair, watching us.

"We're the safest folks in the world," said Miss Maudie. 
"We're so rarely called on to be Christians, but when we are[when we are called on to be Christians], we've got men like
Atticus to go for us."

Jem grinned ruefully. "Wish the rest of the county thought that."
"You'd be surprised how many of us do."
"Who?" Jem's voice rose. "Who in this town did one thing to help Tom Robinson, just who?"

"His colored friends for one thing, and people like us. People
like Judge Taylor. People like Mr. Heck Tate. 
Stop eating and start thinking, Jem. 
Did it[形式主语,指代后文的宾语从句内容] ever strike you that Judge Taylor naming Atticus
to defend that boy was no accident? 
That Judge Taylor might have had his reasons for naming him?" 


This was a thought. Court-appointed defenses were usually given to Maxwell Green, 
Maycomb's latest addition to the bar, who needed the experience. 
Maxwell Green should have had Tom Robinson's case.

Mrs. Merriweather faced Mrs. Farrow: 
"Gertrude, I tell you there's nothing more distracting than a sulky darky. 
Their mouths go down to here. 
Just ruins your day to have one of them in the kitchen. 
You know what I said to my Sophy, Gertrude? 

I said, 'Sophy, you simply are not being a Christian today. 
Jesus Christ never went around grumbling and complaining,'

and you know, it did her good.
She took her eyes off that floor and said, 

'Nome, Mrs. Merriweather, Jesus never went around grumbling.'

I tell you, Gertrude, you never
ought to let an opportunity go by to witness for the Lord."

Mrs. Farrow was a splendidly built woman with pale eyes and narrow feet.

It's never entered that wool of hers 
that the only reason I keep her is 
because this depression's on and she needs her dollar and a quarter every week she can get it.


His food doesn't stick going down, does it?

Two tight lines had appeared at the corners
of her mouth. She had been sitting silently beside me, her coffee
cup balanced on one knee. I had lost the thread of conversation long
ago, when they quit talking about Tom Robinson's wife, and had
contented myself with thinking of Finch's Landing and the river.



dreary |ˈdrɪəri; 美 ˈdrɪri|
thread |θred|

 
When Miss Maudie was angry her brevity was icy.
Something had made her deeply angry, 
and her gray eyes were as cold as her voice. 
Mrs. Merriweather reddened, glanced at me, and looked away.
I could not see Mrs. Farrow. 

brevity |ˈbrevəti|
icy |ˈaɪsi|


Aunt Alexandra got up from the table and swiftly passed more refreshments, 
neatly engaging Mrs. Merriweather and Mrs. Gates in brisk conversation. 

When she had them well on the road with Mrs. Perkins,  Aunt Alexandra stepped back. 
She gave Miss Maudie a look of pure gratitude, and I wondered at the world of women. 

Miss Maudie and Aunt Alexandra had never been especially close, 
and here was Aunty silently thanking her for something. 

For what, I knew not. I was content to learn that Aunt Alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude for help given. 

There was no doubt about it, I must soon enter this world, 
where on its surface fragrant ladies rocked slowly, fanned gently, and drank cool water. 

But I was more at home in my father's world. 
People like Mr. Heck Tate did not trap you with innocent questions to make fun of you; 
even Jem was not highly critical unless you said something stupid. 
Ladies seemed to live in faint horror of men,  seemed unwilling to approve wholeheartedly of them. 

But I liked them. There was something about them, 
no matter how much they cussed and drank and gambled and chewed; 
no matter how undelectable they were, 
there was something about them that I instinctively liked.

there wasn't a thing Atticus could do to make being shut up easier for him

​​He hated being shut up.​

him to be home, and on Missionary Society days he usually stayed
downtown until black dark.

And so they went, down the row of laughing women, around the

Aunt Alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled. She looked
at a tray of cookies on the table and nodded at them. 
I carefully picked up the tray and watched myself walk to Mrs. Merriweather.

With my best company manners, I asked her if she would have some.

After all, if Aunty could be a lady at a time like this, so could I.

I scooped up the small creature, placed him on the bottom
step and went back to my cot. 
September had come, but not a trace of
cool weather with it, and we were still sleeping on the back screen
porch. 

Lightning bugs were still about, 
the night crawlers and flying insects that 
beat against the screen the summer long 
had not gone wherever they go when autumn comes.

Jem was the one who was getting more like a girl every day, not I.
Comfortable, I lay on my back and waited for sleep, and while
waiting I thought of Dill. 

He had left us the first of the month
with firm assurances that he would return the minute school was out 
and he guessed his folks had got the general idea that he liked to spend
his summers in Maycomb. 

Miss Rachel took us with them in the taxi to Maycomb Junction,
and Dill waved to us from the train window until
he was out of sight. 

He was not out of mind and I missed him. 
The last two days of his time with us, Jem had taught him to swim. 
I was wide awake, remembering what Dill had told me.

Barker's Eddy is at the end of a dirt road off the Meridian highway about a mile from town. 
It is easy to catch a ride down the highway on a cotton wagon or from a passing motorist, 
and the short walk to the creek is easy, 
but the prospect of walking all the way back home at dusk, 
when the traffic is light, is tiresome, 
and swimmers are careful not to stay too late.

 A little girl came to the cabin door and stood looking at Atticus.
Dill said her hair was a wad of tiny stiff pigtails, each ending in
a bright bow. She grinned from ear to ear and walked toward our
father, but she was too small to navigate the steps. Dill said Atticus
went to her, took off his hat, and offered her his finger. She grabbed
it and he eased her down the steps. Then he gave her to Calpurnia.

A few more details,
enabling the listener to repeat his version in turn, 
then nothing to talk about until The Maycomb Tribune
appeared the following Thursday. 
There was a brief obituary in the Colored News, but there was also an editorial.

Mr. Underwood didn't talk about miscarriages of justice, he was writing so children could understand.​
Mr. Underwood simply figured it was a sin to kill cripples, be they standing, sitting, or escaping.​
He likened Tom's death to the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and children, 
and Maycomb thought he was trying to write an editorial poetical enough to be reprinted in The Montgomery Advertiser.​

He went out for football, 
but was too slender and too young yet to do anything but carry the team water buckets. 
This he did with enthusiasm; 
most afternoons he was seldom home before dark.

The Radley Place had ceased to terrify me, but it was no less
gloomy, no less chilly under its great oaks, and no less uninviting.

This was the first time he had let us know he knew a lot more about something than we thought he knew.​


So many things had happened to us, Boo Radley was the least of our fears.​
Atticus said he didn't see how anything else could happen, 
that things had a way of settling down, 
and after enough time passed people would forget that Tom Robinson's existence was ever brought to their attention.​





The events of the summer hung over us like smoke in a closed room.​

The adults in Maycomb never discussed the case with Jem and me; 
it seemed that they discussed it with their children, 
and their attitude must have been that neither of us could help having Atticus for a parent, 
so their children must be nice to us in spite of him.​

This practice allegedly overcame a variety of evils,

Atticus said that Jem was trying hard to forget something, but
what he was really doing was storing it away for a while, until enough
time passed. Then he would be able to think about it and sort things

Misses Tutti and Frutti Barber were maiden ladies, sisters, who
lived together in the only Maycomb residence boasting a cellar. The
Barber ladies were rumored to be Republicans, having migrated from
Clanton, Alabama, in 1911. Their ways were strange to us, and why they
wanted a cellar nobody knew, but they wanted one and they dug one,
and they spent the rest of their lives chasing generations of children out of it.

Misses Tutti and Frutti (their names were Sarah and Frances),
aside from their Yankee ways, were both deaf. Miss Tutti denied it and
lived in a world of silence, but Miss Frutti, not about to miss
anything, employed an ear trumpet so enormous that Jem declared it was
a loudspeaker from one of those dog Victrolas. 

trumpet |ˈtrʌmpɪt|

With these facts in mind and Halloween at hand, some wicked children
had waited until the Misses Barber were thoroughly asleep, slipped
into their livingroom (nobody but the Radleys locked up at night),
stealthily made away with every stick of furniture therein, and hid it
in the cellar. I deny having taken part in such a thing.

High above us in the darkness a solitary mocker poured out his repertoire

It was far away from teachers, their spies, and curious neighbors，
it was near the Radley lot, but the Radleys were not curious. 
A small patch of earth beneath its branches was packed hard from many fights and furtive crap games.

Something crushed the chicken wire around me. 
Metal ripped on metal and I fell to the ground and rolled as far as I could,
floundering to escape my wire prison. 

From somewhere near by came scuffling, kicking sounds, 
sounds of shoes and flesh scraping dirt and roots. 

Someone rolled against me and I felt Jem. 
He was up like lightning and pulling me with him but, 
though my head and shoulders were free, 
I was so entangled we didn't get very far.

jerk backwards to the ground. 
More scuffling, and there came a dull crunching sound and Jem screamed.

I ran in the direction of Jem's scream and sank into a flabby male stomach. 
Its owner said, "Uff!" and tried to catch my arms, but they were tightly pinioned. 
His stomach was soft but his arms were like steel. 
He slowly squeezed the breath out of me. 
I could not move.
Suddenly he was jerked backwards and flung on the ground, almost carrying me with him. 
I thought, Jem's up.

It was a relief to be out. My arms were beginning to tingle, 
and they were red with small hexagonal marks. 
I rubbed them, and they felt better.

She left it at that. 
She brought me something to put on, 
and had I thought about it then, 
I would have never let her forget it，
and in her distraction, 
Aunty brought me my overalls. 
"Put these on, darling,"
she said, handing me the garments she most despised.

I knew Dr. Reynolds's step almost as well as my father's. 
He had brought Jem and me into the world, 
had led us through every childhood disease known to man
including the time Jem fell out of the treehouse, 
and he had never lost our friendship.

Dr. Reynolds's step was young and brisk. Mr. Heck Tate's was not.
His heavy boots punished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly,
but he said the same thing Dr. Reynolds said when he came in. "You all
right, Scout?" he added. 


Aunt Alexandra had shaded Jem's reading light with a towel, and his room was dim.

His age was beginning to show, 
his one sign of inner turmoil, 
the strong line of his jaw melted a little, 
one became aware of telltale creases forming under his ears, 
one noticed not his jet-black hair but the gray patches growing at his temples.​​

My eyes traveled up his thin frame to his torn denim shirt. 
His face was as white as his hands, 
but for a shadow on his jutting chin. 
His cheeks were thin to hollowness; 
his mouth was wide; 
there were shallow, almost delicate indentations at his temples, 
and his gray eyes were so colorless I thought he was blind. 
His hair was dead and thin, almost feathery on top of his head.

When I pointed to him his palms slipped slightly, 
leaving greasy sweat streaks on the wall, 
and he hooked his thumbs in his belt.
A strange small spasm shook him, as if he heard fingernails scrape slate, 
but as I gazed at him in wonder the tension slowly drained from his face. 
His lips parted into a timid smile, 
and our neighbor's image blurred with my sudden tears.

Mr. Tate's voice was quiet, but his boots were planted so solidly on
the porch floorboards it seemed that they grew there.

Atticus walked to the corner of the porch. 
He looked at the wisteria vine. 
In his own way, I thought, each was as stubborn as the other. 
I wondered who would give in first. 
Atticus's stubbornness was quiet and rarely evident, 
but in some ways he was as set as the Cunninghams. 
Mr. Tate's was unschooled and blunt, but it was equal to my father's.​

vine |vaɪn|

stubborn |ˈstʌbən; 美 -bərn|

"Heck," Atticus's back was turned. "If this thing's hushed up it'll be a simple denial to Jem of the way I've tried to raise him."​
"Sometimes I think I'm a total failure as a parent, but I'm all they've got."​
"Before Jem looks at anyone else he looks at me, 
and I've tried to live so I can look squarely back at him... if I connived at something like this, 
frankly I couldn't meet his eye, and the day I can't do that I'll know I've lost him."​
"I don't want to lose him and Scout, because they're all I've got."​

Atticus wheeled around. His hands dug into his pockets.
"Heck, can't you even try to see it my way? You've got children of your own, butI'm older than you. 
When mine are grown I'll be an old man if I'm still around, 
but right now I'm - if they don't trust me they won't trust anybody. 
Jem and Scout know what happened. 
If they hear of me saying downtown something different happened - Heck, 
I won't have them any more. 
I can't live one way in town and another way in my home."

Atticus made his way to the swing and sat down.​

Boo had drifted to a corner of the room,

Daylight, in my mind, the night faded. 
It was daytime and the neighborhood was busy. 
Miss Stephanie Crawford crossed the street to tell the latest to Miss Rachel. 
Miss Maudie bent over her azaleas.
It was summertime, and two children scampered down the sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance.

until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them. 
Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.

The street lights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling. 
As I made my way home, 
I felt very old, but when I looked at the tip of my nose I could see fine misty beads, 
but looking cross-eyed made me dizzy so I quit. 
As I made my way home, I thought what a thing to tell Jem tomorrow. 
He'd be so mad he missed it he wouldn't speak to me for days. 
As I made my way home, I thought Jem and I would get grown but there wasn't much else left for us to learn, 
except possibly algebra.

Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. 
They don't eat up people's gardens,
don't nest in corncribs, 
they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. 
That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird




I willed myself to stay awake, 
but the rain was so soft and the room was so warm 
and his voice was so deep and his knee was so snug that I slept. 

He guided me to the bed and sat me down. He lifted my legs 
and put me under the cover. 

"And they chased him and never could catch him  because they didn't
know what he looked like, and  Atticus, when they finally saw him,
why he hadn't done any of those things and Atticus, he was real
nice."


His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it
around me. 

"Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them."

He turned out the light and went into Jem's room. He would be
there all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the
morning.
