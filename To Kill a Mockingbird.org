Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that.

In England, Simon was irritated by the persecution of
those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more
liberal brethren

Mindful of John Wesley's
strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling, Simon
made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit he was unhappy
lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory of
God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel.

mindful |ˈmaɪndfl|
stricture |ˈstrɪktʃə(r)|

So Simon, having
forgotten his teacher's dictum on the possession of human chattels,
bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on
the banks of the Alabama River some forty miles above Saint
Stephens. 

dictum |ˈdɪktəm|

chattel /ˈtʃætl/

He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find a wife, and
with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to
an impressive age and died rich.

impotent |ˈɪmpətənt|

Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance
between the North and the South, as it left his descendants stripped of
everything but their land, 
yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century, when my
father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his younger
brother went to Boston to study medicine.

if his trot-lines were full.

When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and
began his practice.


Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finch's Landing, was the county seat of Maycomb County

escape with their lives

The Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb's leading blacksmith
in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, 
were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses, 
and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-coming-to-him
was a good enough defense for anybody.

blacksmith |ˈblæksmɪθ|
imprudent |ɪmˈpru:dnt|

They persisted in pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, 
so there was nothing much Atticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure, 
an occasion that was probably the beginning of my father's profound distaste 
for the practice of criminal law

distaste |dɪsˈteɪst|


slop |slɒp; 美 slɑ:p|

Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer's day; 
bony mules  hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square.

Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. 
Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps,
and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.

Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been

Dill as a pocket Merlin, whose head teemed with eccentric plans,
strange longings, and quaint fancies.

The Radleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a
predilection unforgivable in Maycomb.They did not go to church,
Maycomb's principal recreation, but worshiped at home;

According to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was
in his teens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from
Old Sarum, an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern
part of the county, and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever
seen in Maycomb.

One night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed
around the square in a borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by
Maycomb's ancient beadle, Mr. Conner, and locked him in the
courthouse outhouse.

spurt |spɜ:t; 美 spɜ:rt|
flivver

The town decided something had to be done; Mr. Conner said
he knew who each and every one of them was, and he was bound and
determined they wouldn't get away with it, so the boys came before the
probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the
peace, assault and battery, and using abusive and profane language
in the presence and hearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner
why he included the last charge; Mr. Conner said they cussed so loud
he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard them.

bound and determined       -very determined to do sth

disgrace |dɪsˈgreɪs|

If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley
would see to it that Arthur gave no further trouble. Knowing that
Mr. Radley's word was his bond, the judge was glad to do so.

Boo drove the
scissors into his parent's leg, pulled them out, wiped them on his
pants, and resumed his activities.

Boo's transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in
Jem's memory. 

nebulous |ˈnebjələs|
council |ˈkaʊnsl|
mold /məʊld/
bounty |ˈbaʊnti|

intimidate |ɪnˈtɪmɪdeɪt|

Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep
Boo out of sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained
to the bed most of the time.

employ - to use sth such as a skill, method, etc. for a particular purpose


Miss Stephanie Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as
his only law, and we believed her, because Mr. Radley's posture was ramrod straight.

ramrod |ˈræmrɒd; 美 -rɑ:d|

ramrod straight | (as) straight as a ramrod

He goes out, all right, when it's pitch dark.

gravel |ˈgrævl|

Boo was about
six-and-a-half feet tall, judging from his tracks; he dined on raw
squirrels and any cats he could catch, that's why his hands were
bloodstained- if you ate an animal raw, you could never wash the blood
off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face; what teeth
he had were yellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most of
the time.

Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet Jem The Gray
Ghost against two Tom Swifts that Jem wouldn't get any farther than
the Radley gate. In all his life, Jem had never declined a dare.
Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more
than his head, for Dill wore him down easily

raid |reɪd|

Jem said he reckoned he wasn't

I hope you've got it through your head that he'll kill us each

Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house, slapped
it with his palm and ran back past us, not waiting to see if his foray
was successful. Dill and I followed on his heels. Safely on our porch,
panting and out of breath, we looked back.

The old house was the same, droopy and sick, but as we stared down
the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move. Flick. A tiny,
almost invisible movement, and the house was still.
