I miss the days when life was so simple           |mɪs| |ðə; ði; strong form ði:|       |wəz; strong form wɒz; 美 wɑ:z| |səʊ; 美 soʊ|
Felt like the glass was always half full          |felt| |laɪk|     |glɑ:s; 美 glæs|   |wəz| |ˈɔ:lweɪz| |hɑ:f; 美 hæf|  |fʊl|
Where did that go?                                |dɪd| |ðæt|

And every second with you was so special          |ənd; ænd| |ˈevri|      |wɪð; wɪθ| |ju; 美 jə; strong form ju:|
Back when we didn't fear the unknowns             |ˈdɪdnt|
But that was long ago                             |bət; strong form bʌt|

Who can say where the path will go?                             |wɪl|
Philosophers guess but they just don't know                     |fɪˈlɒsəfə(r); 美 -ˈlɑ:s-|  |bʌt| |dʒʌst| |dəʊnt|
Maybe that's why                                                
 
We had our heads in the clouds                                  |həd; əd; strong form hæd| - |ɑ:(r); ˈaʊə(r)|  |hedz| |ɪn| |klaʊd|
Thought we had it all figured out                               |θɔ:t|                |ˈfɪgəd; 美 ˈfɪgjərd| |aʊt|
Planning to fly away                                            |before consonants tə; before vowels tu; strong form tu:|
To escape everything on the ground                              

 
But like a plane up in space                                    |pleɪn| - |ʌp| -|ɪn|
We slowly drifted away                                          |driftid| - |əˈweɪ|

And every plan that we made                                     
And dream that we chased                                        |tʃeɪst|-
Are just memories now                                           |ɑ:(r)|    |'memərɪz|
They're just memories now                                       |ðeə(r); ðer|

I'm not sure where everything went wrong                        |nɒt; 美 nɑ:t|              |went|
But I know that we landed where we both belong                  |ˈlændɪd|


I just wish we weren't scared to say                            |wɪʃ|         |skeəd; 美 skerd| |wɜ:nt ˈwɜrənt|
That there's expiration dates on the friends you make           |ðeəz; 美 ðerz|-|ˌekspəˈreɪʃn| |deɪts| |ɒn; 美 ɑ:n; ɔ:n|
As hard as that may sound                                       |hɑ:d; 美 hɑ:rd|- |əz; strong form æz|


Who can say where the path will go?

Philosophers guess but they just don't know

Maybe that's why

We had our heads in the clouds

Thought we had it all figured out

Planning to fly away

To escape everything on the ground

But like a plane up in space

We slowly drifted away

And every plan that we made

And dream that we chased

Are just memories now

They're just memories now

Who can say where the path will go?

Philosophers guess but they just don't know
