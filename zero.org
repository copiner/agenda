- not disturbed or attacked by sb; not prevented from doing sth

Monopolists lie to protect themselves. They know that bragging about their great

their monopoly profits to continue unmolested, they tend to do whatever they can to
conceal their monopoly—usually by exaggerating the power of their (nonexistent)
competition.

innovation |ˌɪnəˈveɪʃn|

incumbent |ɪnˈkʌmbənt|

Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly
profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate. Then monopolies can keep innovating
because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious
research projects that firms locked in competition can’t dream of.

Whatever your views on thermodynamics, it’s a powerful metaphor: in
business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death. If your industry is in a
competitive equilibrium, the death of your business won’t matter to the world; some
other undifferentiated competitor will always be ready to take your place.

characterize |ˈkærəktəraɪz|
pathology |pəˈθɒlədʒi; 美 -ˈθɑ:l-|
Monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an
exception. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.

Tolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: “All happy families are alike; each
unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business is the opposite. All happy
companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All
failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

We teach every young person the same subjects in mostly the
same ways, irrespective of individual talents and preferences. Students who don’t learn
best by sitting still at a desk are made to feel somehow inferior, while children who excel
on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up defining their identities in
terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality.

And it gets worse as students ascend to higher levels of the tournament. Elite students
climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their
dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in
high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional
careers like management consulting and investment banking. For the privilege of being
turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay hundreds of thousands of dollars
in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation. Why are we doing this to
ourselves?

Hamlet:
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honor’s at the stake.

For Hamlet, greatness means willingness to fight for reasons as thin as an eggshell:
anyone would fight for things that matter; true heroes take their personal honor so
seriously they will fight for things that don’t matter. This twisted logic is part of human
nature, but it’s disastrous in business.

-making you feel confused because there are too many things to choose from or because sth is difficult to understand

process trumps substance, when people lack concrete plans to carry out, they use formal
rules to assemble a portfolio of various options.This describes Americans today. In
middle school, we’re encouraged to start hoarding “extracurricular activities.” In high
school, ambitious students compete even harder to appear omnicompetent. By the time a
student gets to college, he’s spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse résumé to
prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he’s ready—for nothing in
particular.

institutionalized education traffics in a kind of

system learns not to think in power law terms. Every high school course period lasts 45
minutes whatever the subject. Every student proceeds at a similar pace. At college,
model students obsessively hedge their futures by assembling a suite of exotic and minor
skills. 

That is
completely false. It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on
something you’re good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it
will be valuable in the future.

Unless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it’s rarely a good idea to tell
everybody everything that you know.
So who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there’s always a
golden mean between telling nobody and telling everybody—and that’s a company. The
best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden
from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share
your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.

the old rules made and obeyed by the rest of the world. And indeed, “if men were angels,
no government would be necessary.” But anarchic companies miss what James Madison
saw: men aren’t angels. That’s why executives who manage companies and directors
who govern them have separate roles to play; it’s also why founders’ and investors’
claims on a company are formally defined. You need good people who get along, but you
also need a structure to help keep everyone aligned for the long term.

misalignment |ˌmɪsəˈlaɪnmənt|

anticipate |ænˈtɪsɪpeɪt|

allocate |ˈæləkeɪt|

comprise |kəmˈpraɪz| verb
-to have sb/sth as parts or members
-to be the parts or members that form sth

To anticipate likely sources of misalignment in any company, it’s useful to distinguish
between three concepts:
• Ownership: who legally owns a company’s equity?
• Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis?
• Control: who formally governs the company’s affairs?
A typical startup allocates ownership among founders, employees, and investors. The
managers and employees who operate the company enjoy possession. And a board of
directors, usually comprising founders and investors, exercises control.


In theory, this division works smoothly. Financial upside from part ownership attracts
and rewards investors and workers. Effective possession motivates and empowers
founders and employees—it means they can get stuff done. Oversight from the board
places managers’ plans in a broader perspective. In practice, distributing these functions
among different people makes sense, but it also multiplies opportunities for
misalignment.

But we
only react negatively to awkward, obvious salesmen—that is, the bad ones. There’s a
wide range of sales ability: there are many gradations between novices, experts, and
masters. There are even sales grandmasters. If you don’t know any grandmasters, it’s not
because you haven’t encountered them, but rather because their art is hidden in plain

employee, a founder, or an investor. It’s true even if your company consists of just you
and your computer. Look around. If you don’t see any salespeople, you’re the
salesperson.

When Perot warned about foreign competition, both George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton
preached the gospel of free trade: since every person has a relative strength at some
particular job, in theory the economy maximizes wealth when people specialize
according to their advantages and then trade with each other. In practice, it’s not
unambiguously clear how well free trade has worked, for many workers at least. Gains
from trade are greatest when there’s a big discrepancy in comparative advantage, but the
global supply of workers willing to do repetitive tasks for an extremely small wage is
extremely large.
People don’t just compete to supply labor; they also demand the same resources.
While American consumers have benefited from access to cheap toys and textiles from
China, they’ve had to pay higher prices for the gasoline newly desired by millions of
Chinese motorists. Whether people eat shark fins in Shanghai or fish tacos in San Diego,
they all need food and they all need shelter. And desire doesn’t stop at subsistence—
people will demand ever more as globalization continues. Now that millions of Chinese
peasants can finally enjoy a secure supply of basic calories, they want more of them to
come from pork instead of just grain. The convergence of desire is even more obvious at
the top: all oligarchs have the same taste in Cristal, from Petersburg to Pyongyang.

Most cleantech
companies crashed because they neglected one or more of the seven questions that every
business must answer:
1. The Engineering Question
Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
2. The Timing Question
Is now the right time to start your particular business?
3. The Monopoly Question
Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
4. The People Question
Do you have the right team?
5. The Distribution Question
Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
6. The Durability Question
Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
7. The Secret Question
Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?
We’ve discussed these elements before. Whatever your industry, any great business
plan must address every one of them. If you don’t have good answers to these questions,
you’ll run into lots of “bad luck” and your business will fail. If you nail all seven, you’ll
master fortune and succeed. Even getting five or six correct might work. But the striking
thing about the cleantech bubble was that people were starting companies with zero good
answers—and that meant hoping for a miracle

valuation |ˌvæljuˈeɪʃn|
sector |ˈsektə(r)|

The 1990s had one big idea: the internet is going to be big. But too many internet
companies had exactly that same idea and no others. An entrepreneur can’t benefit from
macro-scale insight unless his own plans begin at the micro-scale. Cleantech companies
faced the same problem: no matter how much the world needs energy, only a firm that
offers a superior solution for a specific energy problem can make money. No sector will
ever be so important that merely participating in it will be enough to build a great
company.


niche |ni:ʃ; nɪtʃ; 美 nɪtʃ; ni:ʃ| noun
-a comfortable or suitable role, job, way of life, etc.
-an opportunity to sell a particular product to a particular group of people

The macro need for energy solutions is still real. But a valuable
business must start by finding a niche and dominating a small market.

scapegoat |ˈskeɪpgəʊt; 美 -goʊt|

The famous and infamous have always served as vessels for public sentiment: they’re
praised amid prosperity and blamed for misfortune. Primitive societies faced one
fundamental problem above all: they would be torn apart by conflict if they didn’t have a
way to stop it. So whenever plagues, disasters, or violent rivalries threatened the peace, it
was beneficial for the society to place the entire blame on a single person, someone
everybody could agree on: a scapegoat.
Before execution, scapegoats were often worshipped like deities. The Aztecs
considered their victims to be earthly forms of the gods to whom they were sacrificed.
You would be dressed in fine clothes and feast royally until your brief reign ended and
they cut your heart out. These are the roots of monarchy: every king was a living god,
and every god a murdered king. Perhaps every modern king is just a scapegoat who has
managed to delay his own execution.

Jobs’s return to Apple 12 years later shows how the most important task in business—
the creation of new value—cannot be reduced to a formula and applied by professionals.
When he was hired as interim CEO of Apple in 1997, the impeccably credentialed
executives who preceded him had steered the company nearly to bankruptcy

A unique founder can make authoritative decisions, inspire strong personal
loyalty, and plan ahead for decades. Paradoxically, impersonal bureaucracies staffed by
trained professionals can last longer than any lifetime, but they usually act with short
time horizons.

disenchantment |ˌdɪs.ɪnˈtʃɑːnt.mənt| noun
-a feeling of no longer believing in the value of something, especially having learned of the problems with it

Above all, don’t overestimate your own power as an individual. Founders are
important not because they are the only ones whose work has value, but rather because a
great founder can bring out the best work from everybody at his company. 


There is no Galt’s Gulch. There is no secession from society. To believe
yourself invested with divine self-sufficiency is not the mark of a strong individual, but
of a person who has mistaken the crowd’s worship—or jeering—for the truth. The single
greatest danger for a founder is to become so certain of his own myth that he loses his
mind. But an equally insidious danger for every business is to lose all sense of myth and
mistake disenchantment for wisdom.

The ancients saw all of history as a neverending alternation between prosperity and

misfortune, and it’s still possible to wonder whether the stability we take for granted will
last.

transcend |trænˈsend|

But no matter how many trends can be traced, the future won’t happen on its own.
What the Singularity would look like matters less than the stark choice we face today
between the two most likely scenarios: nothing or something. It’s up to us. We cannot
take for granted that the future will be better, and that means we need to work to create it
today.

cosmic |ˈkɒzmɪk; 美 ˈkɑ:z-|

Whether we achieve the Singularity on a cosmic scale is perhaps less important than
whether we seize the unique opportunities we have to do new things in our own working
lives. Everything important to us—the universe, the planet, the country, your company,
your life, and this very moment—is singular.

anew |əˈnju:; 美 əˈnu:|

Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the
future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think
for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the
ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.
