vulnerable |ˈvʌlnərəbl|

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind
ever since.

‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,
‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had
the advantages that you’ve had.’

He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually
communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim
of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a
normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy
to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.
Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,
preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young
men or at least the terms in which they express them are
usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.
I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that,
as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense
of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at
birth.

在我年少轻狂、易受摧折的时候，我的父亲曾给过我一个忠告，我至今都在咀嚼思量。

“当你想批评一个人的时候，”他对我说，“要记得，这世上不是所有人都拥有你这样的好条件。”

他没有再多说什么，但我们父子总是会心照不宣地理解彼此，所以我听懂了他颇有深意的弦外之音。
从那以后，我养成了凡事不妄下评判的习惯。这让许多性情古怪之人愿意对我坦诚相待，同时也让我苦于忍受灵魂贫瘠之人的唠叨骚扰。
当这样的品性出现在一个正常人身上，就会引来龌龊变态的侧目，他们会对此纠缠不休。
于是我在大学里被冤枉是伪善的政客，因为我了解那些放浪形骸的无名小卒隐秘的愁苦。
这些秘密大多都是自己跑到我耳朵里的——一旦我觉察到某种确定无误的信号，发现有秘密即将呼之欲出，
我就总会假装睡着、专心做事，或者轻佻地敷衍过去——毕竟毛头小子吐露的心声，至少是他们用来自我剖析的说辞，
都是套用别人的话，又明显心里压抑，所以支吾含糊。不妄下评判，就总能留点希望。我现在都还有点害怕，
如果我忘了这条父亲带着优越感的指教，而我也带着优越感反复记忆的忠告——并非人人生来都享有维持体面生活的必需品，我会错过些什么。

And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to
the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded
on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point
I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from
the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in
uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; 
I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses
into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his
name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby
who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. 
If personality is an unbroken series of successful
gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he
were related to one of those intricate machines that register
earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness
had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which
is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’—
it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness
such as I have never found in any other person and which
it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned
out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what
foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily
closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.

自夸完我的包容，我还是得承认，我的包容也有限度。人的行为可能是稳如磐石的理性结果，
也可能来自混沌污糟的糊涂头脑，反正只要行为超过某个限度，无论它源于理性还是糊涂，我就都不在乎了。

去年秋天从东部回来之后，我开始希望这世上的人都能穿上军装，在道德上永远立正站好；
我不想再肆无忌惮地纵览世情，去窥见唯有我才能洞穿的人心。只有盖茨比——就是将自己的名字赋与本书的男人，
不必面对我这样的反应——盖茨比代表了所有我真心鄙夷的东西。假如人格就是一连串毫无破绽的成功姿态，那他还算有几分迷人；
他对如何达成圆满的人生颇为敏锐，仿佛一台能将千里之外的地震都捕捉到的精密仪器。
这种感应能力，不是美其名曰“创造者气质”的那种软弱纠结的敏感——它是一种永远在追寻希望的非凡天赋，是一种激情澎湃的自信欣然。
我好像从未在其他人身上看到这一点，可能以后也不会看到。
算了——说到底，盖茨比这个人总归是不错的，是那些侵蚀了他的东西，那些在他迷梦消散后浮现出的污浊尘垢，让我对人们失败的悲伤与一时的得意暂时失去了兴趣。


My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in
this middle-western city for three generations.
The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that
we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother who
came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and
started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.

ragged |ˈrægɪd|

I never saw this great-uncle but I’m supposed to look
like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled
painting that hangs in Father’s office. I graduated from New
Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father,
and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. 
I enjoyed the counter-raid
so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the
warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like
the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and
learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond
business so I supposed it could support one more single
man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were
choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ‘Why—yees’ with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance
me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.

lawn |lɔ:n|

The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was
a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns
and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town
it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather
beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the
last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went
out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a
few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish
woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.

It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man,
more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.

It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a
house in one of the strangest communities in North America. 
It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself
due east of New York and where there are, among other
natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. 

Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in
contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into
the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western
Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.

They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus
story they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but
their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual
confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a
more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every
particular except shape and size.

出于某种机缘，我租的房子恰巧在北美洲最奇特的地区之一。
这是一个奇形怪状的狭长岛屿，一端正对着纽约东部。岛上自然奇观众多，
其中一个就是这岛其实是由两个形状特异的半岛组成。这两个半岛距离市区有三公里，
像一对巨大的卵，形状完全一致，互为镜像，仅仅相隔一条和缓的小湾。
那条小湾最终会汇入西半球最为恬静的咸水流域，也就是仿若一座水上谷仓的长岛海峡。

这两个半岛并非完整浑圆的卵形——它们像哥伦布传说中的鸡蛋一样，
各自竖起的支点都是扁平的——不过，地形如此相似，也足以让海鸥每每飞过都迷惑不已了。
而对没长翅膀的人类来说，更有意思的现象是，这两个半岛除了形状和大小之外，每一处都毫不相同。

I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the
two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and 
not a little sinister contrast between them. My
house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the
Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented
for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.

The one on my right
was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on
one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a
marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn
and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. 

Or rather, as I didn’t
know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it
was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and
the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.

Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable
East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the
summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to
have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second
cousin once removed and I’d known Tom in college. And
just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.

Her husband, among various physical accomplishments,
had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played
football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of
those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at
twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax.

His family were enormously wealthy—even in college
his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but
now he’d left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather
took your breath away: for instance he’d brought down a
string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough
to do that.

Why they came east I don’t know. They had spent a year
in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here
and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were
rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over
the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into
Daisy’s heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking
a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some
irrecoverable football game.


那条小湾的对岸，是时髦的东卵上那套如白色宫殿般临水闪耀的豪宅。这个夏天的故事，就在我晚上开车造访那里，
与汤姆·布坎南共进晚餐时，真正拉开了序幕。黛西是我远房的二表妹，
而汤姆则是我在大学就认识的。战争刚刚结束那会儿，我在芝加哥还跟他们共度过两天。



黛西的丈夫，擅长各种运动，此外还曾是纽黑文历史上最厉害的橄榄球端锋球员之一——在某种程度上来说，
也算是名扬全国了。他在二十一岁时就在特定领域里攀至巅峰，以至于之后的一切经历都有点走下坡路的意味。

他家财万贯——即使在大学里，他的挥霍无度都饱受非议——而如今他离开芝加哥来到东部，
搬家的排场更是令人大吃一惊：比如说，他竟然从森林湖运过来一大批用于马球比赛的小马驹！
一个与我同辈的人，居然阔绰到能做出这种事来，简直太罕见了。

我不清楚他们夫妇为什么来东部。他们在法国待过一年，也没什么特别的原因，
之后又四处游荡，哪里有富人扎堆玩马球，他们就去哪里。
这趟来了就不走了——黛西在电话里是这么说的，但我并不相信——我摸不透黛西的心思，
但我有预感汤姆会永远游荡下去，带着一丝惆怅的渴望，去追寻某一场再也无法重来的橄榄球赛那种跌宕起伏的激昂。

scarcely |ˈskeəsli; 美 ˈskers-|

And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I
drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. 
Their house was even more elaborate than I
expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. 
The lawn started at the beach and
ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping
over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally 
when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright
vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front
was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with
reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon,
and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his
legs apart on the front porch.

总之故事就这样发生了：在一个轻风和煦的夜晚，我开车来到东卵，看望两位我其实一点也不了解的老朋友。
他们的房子甚至比我想象的还要精致华丽，这是一座赏心悦目，红白相间，乔治亚殖民时期风格的公馆，
可远眺那条小湾。草坪从海滩一路蔓延至大门，足有四百米远，绕过一个个日晷、一面面砖墙和一座座姹紫嫣红的花园——最终抵达公馆时，
青草贴着墙的一侧向上爬，融入了葱郁的藤蔓，仿佛一路飞奔后，顺势跃升了起来。
大门两侧是一扇扇落地长窗，此刻正在夕阳的金光下闪闪发亮。
窗户大开着，迎进了傍晚和煦的风。窗外是一身骑装的汤姆·布坎南，他正两腿叉开，站在大门口的门廊上。

He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he
was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard
mouth and a supercilious manner. 

Two shining, arrogant
eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him
the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. 

Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide
the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those
glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you
could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder
moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.


His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. 
There was a touch of
paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and
there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.

‘Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,’ he seemed to say, ‘just because I’m stronger and more of a
man than you are.’ We were in the same Senior Society, and
while we were never intimate I always had the impression
that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with
some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.

自从结束在纽黑文的那段光辉岁月，他变了很多。如今他是一个三十岁的男人，体格健壮，头发粗硬如稻草，嘴唇紧抿，举止倨傲。


一双炯炯有神却满是傲慢的眼睛，是他脸上最突出的部分，让他看上去总是有种侵略性的姿态。就连他身上那套有点女气的时髦骑装，
都掩不住他这副身躯的巨大威力——他仿佛撑满了那双锃亮的靴子，把最上端的鞋带都绷紧了。
随着他肩膀的转动，只见偾张的肌肉在他薄薄的外套下滑动。这是一具极富力量的躯体——一具残暴的躯体。

他说话的声音，是粗哑的男高音，给他那股子强势又添了一分戾气。他说起话来带着一种父辈般居高临下的贬损，即便对他喜欢的人也是如此——在纽黑文时就有不少人厌烦他这股傲劲儿。

“我说，我是比你更强壮，更像个男人，”他仿佛在这么说，“但别因为这个就指望我在这些事上拿主意。
”我们俩曾参加过同一个高年级社团，虽然完全谈不上亲近，但我总觉得他挺认可我，
还自顾自地用一种尖锐挑衅的方式，想让我也欣赏他。

We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosycolored space, fragilely bound into the house by French
windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming
white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a
little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room,
blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags,
twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the
ceiling—and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.

The only completely stationary object in the room was an
enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed
up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both
in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if
they had just been blown back in after a short flight around
the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to 
the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. 
Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan
shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about
the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young
women ballooned slowly to the floor.

divan |dɪˈvæn; 美 ˈdaɪvæn|

The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was
extended full length at her end of the divan, completely
motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were
balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If
she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of
it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology 
for having disturbed her by coming in.

conscientious |ˌkɒnʃiˈenʃəs; 美 ˌkɑ:n-|
absurd |əbˈsɜ:d; 美 əbˈsɜ:rd|

The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she

then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I
laughed too and came forward into the room.

At any rate Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me
almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back
again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered
a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of 
apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete
self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.

I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. 
It was the kind of voice that
the ear follows up and down as if each speech 
is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was
sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a
bright passionate mouth—but there was an excitement in
her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to
forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ‘Listen,’ a promise that she had done gay, 
exciting things just a while since
and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next
hour.

She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated
by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young
cadet.  Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with
polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented face. 
It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a
picture of her, somewhere before.

我喜欢看她，她是个纤瘦的平胸姑娘，身姿挺拔——她特意用力让肩膀向后，
就像军校里的小学员那样。她那双因久经日晒而眯起来的灰眼睛回望着我，
苍白而带着不满的迷人脸庞上，有一丝礼貌致意的好奇。我这才想起之前曾在哪里见过她，或者是她的照片。

Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively 
and with a bantering inconsequence that was never
quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and
their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were
here—and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant 
effort to entertain or to be entertained. They
knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later
the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was
sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from 
phase to phase toward its close in a continually
disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of
the moment itself.

她和贝克小姐有时会同时开口交谈，但并不引人注意，因为她们无非是开开无关紧要的小玩笑，
连闲聊都谈不上，冷淡得一如她们洁白的裙子，以及那无情无感、无欲无求的眼睛。
她们人是在这儿——也在应酬汤姆和我，却只是礼貌性地做出取悦别人或被人取悦的反应。
她们知道眼下这顿晚餐总会散席，不一会儿这个晚上也将过去，
时光随随便便就打发掉了。这里的生活跟西部大不一样，西部的晚间聚会，
时间会在一茬接一茬的事情里匆匆流向终点，让人接连体验那终将失望的期望，或者只顾得上对时光终结感到忧虑恐慌。

There was something pathetic in his concentration as if

rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon
the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.

For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection 
upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward
breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light

in one of those breathless, thrilling words.

A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and
Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The
murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,
mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.

The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook
her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact
all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments
of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being
lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look
squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t
guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even
Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy
skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. 
To a certain temperament the
situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct
was to telephone immediately for the police.

屋里的电话又响了，简直不可思议。黛西冲汤姆断然摇头，马的话题——实际上，
是所有话题——便都就此消散了。我对刚刚餐桌上那五分钟发生的事情印象凌乱，
只记得那几根蜡烛又无缘无故地点起来了，而我发现自己很想正眼瞧瞧每一个人，
但又得避开他们的眼神。我猜不出黛西和汤姆正在想什么，
不过我怀疑就算是贝克小姐——她好像已经压抑住了自己有理有据的质疑——也没办法完全不在意这第五位客人突兀又尖锐的来电铃响。
对某种个性的人来说，此情此景可能还挺有趣的——我自己是本能地想立刻打电话报警的。

The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my 
attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she
had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening
had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. 
I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she
looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if
she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished
secret society to which she and Tom belonged

Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and
in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat
out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West
Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an
abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off,
leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees
and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth
blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered 
across the moonlight and turning my head to watch
it I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had
emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and
was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the
silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and 
the secure position of his feet upon the lawn
suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine 
what share was his of our local heavens.

screen |skri:n| verb

About half way between West Egg and New York, 
the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it 
for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain 
desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes——a fantastic 
farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take 
the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, 
with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.
Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastlycreak and comes to rest, 
and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leadenspades and 
stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight.

Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice 
in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or 
forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many 
paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.

The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, 
and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, 
the passengers on waiting trains can stare 
at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. 
There is always a halt there of at least a minute and 
it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.

His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. 
Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure 
of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle 
thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously 
as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, 
contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible 
vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering.

Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.

With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. 
The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage 
was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became 
more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded, 
the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, 
creaking pivot through the smoky air.

Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches,
which were a complete supper in themselves. 
I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft 
twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument 
which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. 
Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed 
their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, 
and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, 
simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.

There was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. 
In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among 
the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the 
afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or 
taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats 
slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. 
On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from 
the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, 
while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. 
And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day 
with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, 
repairing the ravages of the night before.

Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a

in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges 
in half an hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's thumb.

On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d'oeuvre, 
spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs 
and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.

By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair 
but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and 
cornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers 
have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; 
the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, 
and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors 
and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. 
The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate 
the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter 
and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot 
and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.

stout |staʊt|
joyous |ˈdʒɔɪəs| joyful
glide |glaɪd|

The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and 
now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera 
of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute, 
spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups 
change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form 
in the same breath--already there are wanderers, confident girls 
who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, 
become for a sharp, 
joyous moment the center of a group and then excited 
with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces 
and voices and color under the constantly changing light.

understudy |ˈʌndəstʌdi; 美 -dərs-|

Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, 
seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage 
and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. 
A momentary hush; the orchestra 
leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and 
there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around 
that she is Gilda Gray's understudy from the "Follies." The party has begun.

the vicinity |vəˈsɪnəti|


Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little 
after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease 
among swirls and eddies of people I didn't know--though here and there was a face 
I had noticed on the commuting train. 
I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about;
all well dressed, all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. 
I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. 
They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and 
convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.

purposeless |ˈpɜ:pəsləs; 美 ˈpɜ:rp-|


As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the 
two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me 
in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of 
his movements that I slunk off in the direction of 
the cocktail table--the only place in the garden where a 
single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.

contemptuous|kənˈtemptʃuəs|
roaring drunk
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment 
when Jordan Baker came out of the house 
and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward 
and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.

address |əˈdres; 美 ˈædres|
cordial |ˈkɔ:diəl; 美 ˈkɔ:rdʒəl|

Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to 
someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.

spectroscope |ˈspektrəskəʊp; 美 -skoʊp|

The first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now being served, 
and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table 
on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan's escort, 
a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression 
that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. 
Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, 
and assumed to itself the function of representing 
the staid nobility of the countryside--East Egg condescending to West Egg, 
and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.

tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.

elemental |ˌelɪˈmentl|

give way

I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man 
of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest 
provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. 
I had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed 
before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.

whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.

Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried 
toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. 
He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.

His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair 
looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. 
I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, 
for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.

rivulet |ˈrɪvjələt|

vinous 

The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow 
was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired 
young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk 
a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had 
decided ineptly that everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, 
she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with 
gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. 
The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when they came into 
contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, 
and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. 
A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face 
whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep.

remaining |rɪˈmeɪnɪŋ|

dissension |dɪˈsenʃn|

actress |ˈæktrəs|
flank |flæŋk|

hiss |hɪs|

I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. 
Even Jordan's party, the quartet from East Egg, 
were rent asunder by dissension. 
One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, 
and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way 
broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals she appeared suddenly 
at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed "You promised!" into his ear.

but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.

abstracted |æbˈstræktɪd|

tantalize |ˈtæntəlaɪz|

jaunty |ˈdʒɔ:nti|
salute |səˈlu:t|

melt |melt|

She was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a jaunty salute 
as she melted into her party at the door.

Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, 
I joined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him.

reassuringly 
brush |brʌʃ|
hydroplane |ˈhaɪdrəpleɪn|

"Don't mention it," he enjoined me eagerly. "Don't give it another thought, old sport." 
The familiar expression 
held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. 
"And don't forget we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock."

coupé |ˈku:peɪ; 美 ku:ˈpeɪ|
Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. 
In the ditch beside the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel, 
rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby's drive not two minutes before.

jut |dʒʌt|

detachment |dɪˈtætʃmənt|
chauffeur |ˈʃəʊfə(r); 美 ʃoʊˈfɜ:r|

The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel 
which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs.

discordant |dɪsˈkɔ:dənt; 美 -ˈkɔ:rd-|
din |dɪn|

rear |rɪə(r); 美 rɪr|
audible |ˈɔ:dəbl|

However, as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those 
in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.

duster |ˈdʌstə(r)|
dismount |dɪsˈmaʊnt|
mount

wreck |rek|

tire |ˈtaɪə(r)|  =tyre

A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, 
looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.

patron |ˈpeɪtrən|
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder 
and then the man--it was the late patron of Gatsby's library.
