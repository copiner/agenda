vulnerable |ˈvʌlnərəbl|

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind
ever since.

‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,
‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had
the advantages that you’ve had.’

He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually
communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim
of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a
normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy
to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.
Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,
preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young
men or at least the terms in which they express them are
usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.
I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that,
as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense
of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at
birth.

在我年少轻狂、易受摧折的时候，我的父亲曾给过我一个忠告，我至今都在咀嚼思量。

“当你想批评一个人的时候，”他对我说，“要记得，这世上不是所有人都拥有你这样的好条件。”

他没有再多说什么，但我们父子总是会心照不宣地理解彼此，所以我听懂了他颇有深意的弦外之音。
从那以后，我养成了凡事不妄下评判的习惯。这让许多性情古怪之人愿意对我坦诚相待，同时也让我苦于忍受灵魂贫瘠之人的唠叨骚扰。
当这样的品性出现在一个正常人身上，就会引来龌龊变态的侧目，他们会对此纠缠不休。
于是我在大学里被冤枉是伪善的政客，因为我了解那些放浪形骸的无名小卒隐秘的愁苦。
这些秘密大多都是自己跑到我耳朵里的——一旦我觉察到某种确定无误的信号，发现有秘密即将呼之欲出，
我就总会假装睡着、专心做事，或者轻佻地敷衍过去——毕竟毛头小子吐露的心声，至少是他们用来自我剖析的说辞，
都是套用别人的话，又明显心里压抑，所以支吾含糊。不妄下评判，就总能留点希望。我现在都还有点害怕，
如果我忘了这条父亲带着优越感的指教，而我也带着优越感反复记忆的忠告——并非人人生来都享有维持体面生活的必需品，我会错过些什么。

And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to
the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded
on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point
I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from
the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in
uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; 
I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses
into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his
name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby
who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. 
If personality is an unbroken series of successful
gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he
were related to one of those intricate machines that register
earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness
had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which
is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’—
it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness
such as I have never found in any other person and which
it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned
out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what
foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily
closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.

自夸完我的包容，我还是得承认，我的包容也有限度。人的行为可能是稳如磐石的理性结果，
也可能来自混沌污糟的糊涂头脑，反正只要行为超过某个限度，无论它源于理性还是糊涂，我就都不在乎了。

去年秋天从东部回来之后，我开始希望这世上的人都能穿上军装，在道德上永远立正站好；
我不想再肆无忌惮地纵览世情，去窥见唯有我才能洞穿的人心。只有盖茨比——就是将自己的名字赋与本书的男人，
不必面对我这样的反应——盖茨比代表了所有我真心鄙夷的东西。假如人格就是一连串毫无破绽的成功姿态，那他还算有几分迷人；
他对如何达成圆满的人生颇为敏锐，仿佛一台能将千里之外的地震都捕捉到的精密仪器。
这种感应能力，不是美其名曰“创造者气质”的那种软弱纠结的敏感——它是一种永远在追寻希望的非凡天赋，是一种激情澎湃的自信欣然。
我好像从未在其他人身上看到这一点，可能以后也不会看到。
算了——说到底，盖茨比这个人总归是不错的，是那些侵蚀了他的东西，那些在他迷梦消散后浮现出的污浊尘垢，让我对人们失败的悲伤与一时的得意暂时失去了兴趣。


My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in
this middle-western city for three generations.
The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that
we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother who
came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and
started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.

ragged |ˈrægɪd|

I never saw this great-uncle but I’m supposed to look
like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled
painting that hangs in Father’s office. I graduated from New
Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father,
and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. 
I enjoyed the counter-raid
so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the
warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like
the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and
learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond
business so I supposed it could support one more single
man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were
choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ‘Why—yees’ with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance
me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.

lawn |lɔ:n|

The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was
a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns
and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town
it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather
beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the
last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went
out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a
few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish
woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.

It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man,
more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.

It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a
house in one of the strangest communities in North America. 
It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself
due east of New York and where there are, among other
natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. 

Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in
contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into
the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western
Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.

They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus
story they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but
their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual
confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a
more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every
particular except shape and size.

出于某种机缘，我租的房子恰巧在北美洲最奇特的地区之一。
这是一个奇形怪状的狭长岛屿，一端正对着纽约东部。岛上自然奇观众多，
其中一个就是这岛其实是由两个形状特异的半岛组成。这两个半岛距离市区有三公里，
像一对巨大的卵，形状完全一致，互为镜像，仅仅相隔一条和缓的小湾。
那条小湾最终会汇入西半球最为恬静的咸水流域，也就是仿若一座水上谷仓的长岛海峡。

这两个半岛并非完整浑圆的卵形——它们像哥伦布传说中的鸡蛋一样，
各自竖起的支点都是扁平的——不过，地形如此相似，也足以让海鸥每每飞过都迷惑不已了。
而对没长翅膀的人类来说，更有意思的现象是，这两个半岛除了形状和大小之外，每一处都毫不相同。

I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the
two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and 
not a little sinister contrast between them. My
house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the
Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented
for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.

The one on my right
was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on
one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a
marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn
and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. 

Or rather, as I didn’t
know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it
was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and
the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.

Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable
East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the
summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to
have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second
cousin once removed and I’d known Tom in college. And
just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.

Her husband, among various physical accomplishments,
had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played
football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of
those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at
twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax.

His family were enormously wealthy—even in college
his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but
now he’d left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather
took your breath away: for instance he’d brought down a
string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough
to do that.

Why they came east I don’t know. They had spent a year
in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here
and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were
rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over
the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into
Daisy’s heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking
a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some
irrecoverable football game.


那条小湾的对岸，是时髦的东卵上那套如白色宫殿般临水闪耀的豪宅。这个夏天的故事，就在我晚上开车造访那里，
与汤姆·布坎南共进晚餐时，真正拉开了序幕。黛西是我远房的二表妹，
而汤姆则是我在大学就认识的。战争刚刚结束那会儿，我在芝加哥还跟他们共度过两天。



黛西的丈夫，擅长各种运动，此外还曾是纽黑文历史上最厉害的橄榄球端锋球员之一——在某种程度上来说，
也算是名扬全国了。他在二十一岁时就在特定领域里攀至巅峰，以至于之后的一切经历都有点走下坡路的意味。

他家财万贯——即使在大学里，他的挥霍无度都饱受非议——而如今他离开芝加哥来到东部，
搬家的排场更是令人大吃一惊：比如说，他竟然从森林湖运过来一大批用于马球比赛的小马驹！
一个与我同辈的人，居然阔绰到能做出这种事来，简直太罕见了。

我不清楚他们夫妇为什么来东部。他们在法国待过一年，也没什么特别的原因，
之后又四处游荡，哪里有富人扎堆玩马球，他们就去哪里。
这趟来了就不走了——黛西在电话里是这么说的，但我并不相信——我摸不透黛西的心思，
但我有预感汤姆会永远游荡下去，带着一丝惆怅的渴望，去追寻某一场再也无法重来的橄榄球赛那种跌宕起伏的激昂。

scarcely |ˈskeəsli; 美 ˈskers-|

And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I
drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. 
Their house was even more elaborate than I
expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. 
The lawn started at the beach and
ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping
over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally 
when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright
vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front
was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with
reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon,
and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his
legs apart on the front porch.

总之故事就这样发生了：在一个轻风和煦的夜晚，我开车来到东卵，看望两位我其实一点也不了解的老朋友。
他们的房子甚至比我想象的还要精致华丽，这是一座赏心悦目，红白相间，乔治亚殖民时期风格的公馆，
可远眺那条小湾。草坪从海滩一路蔓延至大门，足有四百米远，绕过一个个日晷、一面面砖墙和一座座姹紫嫣红的花园——最终抵达公馆时，
青草贴着墙的一侧向上爬，融入了葱郁的藤蔓，仿佛一路飞奔后，顺势跃升了起来。
大门两侧是一扇扇落地长窗，此刻正在夕阳的金光下闪闪发亮。
窗户大开着，迎进了傍晚和煦的风。窗外是一身骑装的汤姆·布坎南，他正两腿叉开，站在大门口的门廊上。

He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he
was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard
mouth and a supercilious manner. 

Two shining, arrogant
eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him
the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. 

Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide
the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those
glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you
could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder
moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.


His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. 
There was a touch of
paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and
there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.

‘Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,’ he seemed to say, ‘just because I’m stronger and more of a
man than you are.’ We were in the same Senior Society, and
while we were never intimate I always had the impression
that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with
some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.

自从结束在纽黑文的那段光辉岁月，他变了很多。如今他是一个三十岁的男人，体格健壮，头发粗硬如稻草，嘴唇紧抿，举止倨傲。


一双炯炯有神却满是傲慢的眼睛，是他脸上最突出的部分，让他看上去总是有种侵略性的姿态。就连他身上那套有点女气的时髦骑装，
都掩不住他这副身躯的巨大威力——他仿佛撑满了那双锃亮的靴子，把最上端的鞋带都绷紧了。
随着他肩膀的转动，只见偾张的肌肉在他薄薄的外套下滑动。这是一具极富力量的躯体——一具残暴的躯体。

他说话的声音，是粗哑的男高音，给他那股子强势又添了一分戾气。他说起话来带着一种父辈般居高临下的贬损，即便对他喜欢的人也是如此——在纽黑文时就有不少人厌烦他这股傲劲儿。

“我说，我是比你更强壮，更像个男人，”他仿佛在这么说，“但别因为这个就指望我在这些事上拿主意。
”我们俩曾参加过同一个高年级社团，虽然完全谈不上亲近，但我总觉得他挺认可我，
还自顾自地用一种尖锐挑衅的方式，想让我也欣赏他。

We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosycolored space, fragilely bound into the house by French
windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming
white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a
little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room,
blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags,
twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the
ceiling—and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.

The only completely stationary object in the room was an
enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed
up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both
in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if
they had just been blown back in after a short flight around
the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to 
the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. 
Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan
shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about
the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young
women ballooned slowly to the floor.

divan |dɪˈvæn; 美 ˈdaɪvæn|

The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was
extended full length at her end of the divan, completely
motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were
balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If
she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of
it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology 
for having disturbed her by coming in.

conscientious |ˌkɒnʃiˈenʃəs; 美 ˌkɑ:n-|
absurd |əbˈsɜ:d; 美 əbˈsɜ:rd|

The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she

then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I
laughed too and came forward into the room.

At any rate Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me
almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back
again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered
a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of 
apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete
self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.

I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. 
It was the kind of voice that
the ear follows up and down as if each speech 
is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was
sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a
bright passionate mouth—but there was an excitement in
her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to
forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ‘Listen,’ a promise that she had done gay, 
exciting things just a while since
and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next
hour.

She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated
by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young
cadet.  Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with
polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented face. 
It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a
picture of her, somewhere before.

我喜欢看她，她是个纤瘦的平胸姑娘，身姿挺拔——她特意用力让肩膀向后，
就像军校里的小学员那样。她那双因久经日晒而眯起来的灰眼睛回望着我，
苍白而带着不满的迷人脸庞上，有一丝礼貌致意的好奇。我这才想起之前曾在哪里见过她，或者是她的照片。

Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively 
and with a bantering inconsequence that was never
quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and
their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were
here—and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant 
effort to entertain or to be entertained. They
knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later
the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was
sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from 
phase to phase toward its close in a continually
disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of
the moment itself.

她和贝克小姐有时会同时开口交谈，但并不引人注意，因为她们无非是开开无关紧要的小玩笑，
连闲聊都谈不上，冷淡得一如她们洁白的裙子，以及那无情无感、无欲无求的眼睛。
她们人是在这儿——也在应酬汤姆和我，却只是礼貌性地做出取悦别人或被人取悦的反应。
她们知道眼下这顿晚餐总会散席，不一会儿这个晚上也将过去，
时光随随便便就打发掉了。这里的生活跟西部大不一样，西部的晚间聚会，
时间会在一茬接一茬的事情里匆匆流向终点，让人接连体验那终将失望的期望，或者只顾得上对时光终结感到忧虑恐慌。

There was something pathetic in his concentration as if

rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon
the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.

For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection 
upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward
breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light

in one of those breathless, thrilling words.

A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and
Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The
murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,
mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.

The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook
her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact
all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments
of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being
lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look
squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t
guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even
Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy
skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. 
To a certain temperament the
situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct
was to telephone immediately for the police.

屋里的电话又响了，简直不可思议。黛西冲汤姆断然摇头，马的话题——实际上，
是所有话题——便都就此消散了。我对刚刚餐桌上那五分钟发生的事情印象凌乱，
只记得那几根蜡烛又无缘无故地点起来了，而我发现自己很想正眼瞧瞧每一个人，
但又得避开他们的眼神。我猜不出黛西和汤姆正在想什么，
不过我怀疑就算是贝克小姐——她好像已经压抑住了自己有理有据的质疑——也没办法完全不在意这第五位客人突兀又尖锐的来电铃响。
对某种个性的人来说，此情此景可能还挺有趣的——我自己是本能地想立刻打电话报警的。

The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my 
attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she
had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening
had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. 
I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she
looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if
she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished
secret society to which she and Tom belonged

Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and
in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat
out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West
Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an
abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off,
leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees
and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth
blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered 
across the moonlight and turning my head to watch
it I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had
emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and
was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the
silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and 
the secure position of his feet upon the lawn
suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine 
what share was his of our local heavens.

screen |skri:n| verb

About half way between West Egg and New York, 
the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it 
for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain 
desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes——a fantastic 
farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take 
the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, 
with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.
Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastlycreak and comes to rest, 
and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leadenspades and 
stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight.

Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice 
in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or 
forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many 
paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.

The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, 
and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, 
the passengers on waiting trains can stare 
at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. 
There is always a halt there of at least a minute and 
it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.

His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. 
Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure 
of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle 
thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously 
as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, 
contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible 
vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering.

Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.

With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. 
The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage 
was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became 
more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded, 
the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, 
creaking pivot through the smoky air.

Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches,
which were a complete supper in themselves. 
I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft 
twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument 
which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. 
Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed 
their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, 
and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, 
simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.

There was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. 
In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among 
the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the 
afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or 
taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats 
slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. 
On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from 
the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, 
while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. 
And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day 
with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, 
repairing the ravages of the night before.

Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a

in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges 
in half an hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's thumb.

On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d'oeuvre, 
spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs 
and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.

By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair 
but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and 
cornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers 
have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; 
the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, 
and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors 
and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. 
The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate 
the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter 
and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot 
and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.

joyous |ˈdʒɔɪəs| joyful
glide |glaɪd|

The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and 
now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera 
of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute, 
spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups 
change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form 
in the same breath--already there are wanderers, confident girls 
who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, 
become for a sharp, 
joyous moment the center of a group and then excited 
with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces 
and voices and color under the constantly changing light.

understudy |ˈʌndəstʌdi; 美 -dərs-|

Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, 
seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage 
and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. 
A momentary hush; the orchestra 
leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and 
there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around 
that she is Gilda Gray's understudy from the "Follies." The party has begun.

Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little 
after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease 
among swirls and eddies of people I didn't know--though here and there was a face 
I had noticed on the commuting train. 
I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about;
all well dressed, all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. 
I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. 
They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and 
convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.

purposeless |ˈpɜ:pəsləs; 美 ˈpɜ:rp-|


As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the 
two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me 
in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of 
his movements that I slunk off in the direction of 
the cocktail table--the only place in the garden where a 
single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.

contemptuous|kənˈtemptʃuəs|
roaring drunk
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment 
when Jordan Baker came out of the house 
and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward 
and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.

address |əˈdres; 美 ˈædres|

The first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now being served, 
and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table 
on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan's escort, 
a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression 
that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. 
Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, 
and assumed to itself the function of representing 
the staid nobility of the countryside--East Egg condescending to West Egg, 
and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.

elemental |ˌelɪˈmentl|

give way

I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man 
of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest 
provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. 
I had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed 
before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.

whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.

Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried 
toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. 
He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.

His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair 
looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. 
I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, 
for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.

vinous 

The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow 
was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired 
young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk 
a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had 
decided ineptly that everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, 
she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with 
gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. 
The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when they came into 
contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, 
and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. 
A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face 
whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep.

remaining |rɪˈmeɪnɪŋ|

dissension |dɪˈsenʃn|

actress |ˈæktrəs|
flank |flæŋk|

hiss |hɪs|

I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. 
Even Jordan's party, the quartet from East Egg, 
were rent asunder by dissension. 
One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, 
and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way 
broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals she appeared suddenly 
at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed "You promised!" into his ear.

wayward |ˈweɪwəd; 美 -wərd|

The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men.

but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.

abstracted |æbˈstræktɪd|

tantalize |ˈtæntəlaɪz|

jaunty |ˈdʒɔ:nti|
salute |səˈlu:t|

melt |melt|

She was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a jaunty salute 
as she melted into her party at the door.

Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, 
I joined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him.

"Don't mention it," he enjoined me eagerly. "Don't give it another thought, old sport." 
The familiar expression 
held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. 
"And don't forget we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock."

coupé |ˈku:peɪ; 美 ku:ˈpeɪ|
Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. 
In the ditch beside the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel, 
rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby's drive not two minutes before.

jut |dʒʌt|

detachment |dɪˈtætʃmənt|
chauffeur |ˈʃəʊfə(r); 美 ʃoʊˈfɜ:r|

The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel 
which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs.

din |dɪn|

rear |rɪə(r); 美 rɪr|

However, as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those 
in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.

dismount |dɪsˈmaʊnt|
mount

整个社会，不管是房地产布局收割，还是股市布局收割，也就是一拨人或者说20%的人赚钱，80%人在亏钱；
无形的大手已经安排好了，大部分人无论怎么计谋，估计也进入不了这20%的比例，更不可能通过努力就能实现，
一生只能是韭菜。
社会就是20%设计好有利于他们规则，让80%人遵守规则，成为韭菜的一生。
不管因为什么手段，让自己进入这20%的比例中，那就是舒服一生。
作为韭菜，找到自己的热爱，也能幸福一生。

关于房地产这个市场，所谓的上层群体是怎么设计的
圈地卖钱，房价上涨，地价上涨，收割一波，同时也要做好房价下跌的准备。
要做好关于房地产软着陆与硬着陆的准备。这里解释一下。
说白了，就是100万全跌在同一个人手里，这个人受不了直接跑路不玩了，风险被银行承担，这就是硬着陆；
但如果100万依次跌在5个人手里，每个人亏个20万，虽然肉疼但是没人跑路，这就是软着陆。
但大家要清楚一点，不论是硬着陆还是软着陆，到最后都得着陆，也就是说这100万都得跌掉，就看跌在谁手里了。

硬着陆银行有系统性风险，软着陆消费不景气，市场低迷，一切交给时间，交给下一代吧，没下一代怎么办，鼓励生育。

wreck |rek|

tire |ˈtaɪə(r)|  =tyre

A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, 
looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.

patron |ˈpeɪtrən|
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder 
and then the man--it was the late patron of Gatsby's library.

wash your hands of sb/sth

An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.

The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained "Ah-h-h!" 
as the door of the coupé swung slowly open.

dangle |ˈdæŋgl|
individual |ˌɪndɪˈvɪdʒuəl|

wreck |rek|
paw |pɔ:|
tentative |ˈtentətɪv|
tentatively


The crowd--it was now a crowd--stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. 
Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, 
pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
involuntary |ɪnˈvɒləntri; 美 ɪnˈvɑ:lənteri|

apparition |ˌæpəˈrɪʃn|

Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant 
groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.

caterwaul |ˈkætəwɔ:l; 美 ˈkætər-|
crescendo |krəˈʃendəʊ; 美 -doʊ|

cut across

emptiness |ˈemptinəs|
endow |ɪnˈdaʊ|


The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. 
I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby's house, 
making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. 
A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, 
endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch, 
his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.


Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression 
that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me.

chasm |ˈkæzəm|

riot |ˈraɪət|
mellow |ˈmeləʊ; 美 -loʊ|

stroll |strəʊl; 美 stroʊl|

racy |ˈreɪsi|
flicker |ˈflɪkə(r)|


I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction 
that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. 
I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and 
imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove.

enchanted |ɪnˈtʃɑ:ntɪd; 美 -ˈtʃæntɪd|

haunting |ˈhɔ:ntɪŋ|
loiter |ˈlɔɪtə(r)|   hang around
solitary |ˈsɒlətri; 美 ˈsɑ:ləteri|
poignant |ˈpɔɪnjənt|

At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes,
and felt it in others--poor young clerks 
who loitered in front of windows waiting 
until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner--young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.
 

lane |leɪn|

throb |θrɒb; 美 θrɑ:b|
bound |baʊnd|
Again at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were 
five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, 
I felt a sinking in my heart.

semi-final
proportion |prəˈpɔ:ʃn; 美 -ˈpɔ:rʃn|

At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached 
the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round.
The thing approached the proportions of a scandal--then died away

retract |rɪˈtrækt|
caddy

A caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness 
admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.

instinctively 
instinctive |ɪnˈstɪŋktɪv|

subterfuge |ˈsʌbtəfju:dʒ; 美 -tərf-|
deal in

insolent |ˈɪnsələnt|
jaunty |ˈdʒɔ:nti|

She wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, 
and given this unwillingness I suppose 
she had begun dealing in subterfuges 
when she was very young in order to keep that cool, 
insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy 
the demands of her hard jaunty body.

fender |ˈfendə(r)|
flick |flɪk|

Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.

nevertheless |ˌnevəðəˈles; 美 -vərðə-|
vague |veɪg|
tactful |ˈtæktfl|
tactfully

Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, 
but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and 
for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking 
and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, 
and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. 
I'd been writing letters once a week and signing them: "Love, Nick," 
and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, 
a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless 
there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.



她那双灰色的、久经日晒时刻眯起的眼睛，直直地盯着前方，却已然耍着心计，
改变了我们的关系。有那么一瞬间，我都觉得我爱上她了。可惜我脑筋迟钝，骨子里还守着一堆清规戒律，这性子能像刹车一样刹住我的情欲；
何况我也清楚，我得先从家乡那段纠结的关系里脱身。
一直以来，我每周都会写一次信，还会署名“爱你的，尼克”，
可我想到那位姑娘时，却只能想起她打网球时上嘴唇挂着的胡子一样浅浅的汗印。
即便如此，我和她之间也确实存在一个不正式的约定，只有巧妙地解除了它，我才能自由。

cardinal |ˈkɑ:dɪnl; 美 ˈkɑ:rd-|

Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, 
and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.

人人都认为自己至少拥有一项基本的美德，而我的美德是：在我所认识的人当中，诚实的人寥寥无几，我就是其一。

He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car 
with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American--that comes, 
I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, 
even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.

It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here 
and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, 
and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. 
Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town.

on the knee of his caramel-colored suit.

With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. 
The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image

at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.

It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway

looking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.

He wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. 
We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, 
and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds.


他没有再说什么。我们离市区越来越近，他也越来越端正自持。
我们经过罗斯福港，瞥见几艘刷着一圈红漆的远洋轮船，
又从一个贫民区旁疾驰而过，碎石路边排列着许多二十世纪初就有的小酒馆，
昏暗幽然，镀金时代的风采尽褪，但依旧有人光顾它们。

Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant 
flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps

The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, 
in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.

my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.

Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant 
whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting

A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, 
forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, 
began to eat with ferocious delicacy. 
His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly 
all around the room--he completed the arc by turning to 
inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, 
he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.

bandage |ˈbændɪdʒ|

I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, 
because of all the older girls I admired her most. 
She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. 
I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come that day? 
The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, 
in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, 
and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. 
His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again 
for over four years--even after I'd met him on Long Island 
I didn't realize it was the same man.

Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, 
all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.

irregularity |ɪˌregjəˈlærəti|
time 

Perhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. 
You can hold your tongue and, moreover, 
you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care.

amour |əˈmʊə(r); 美 əˈmʊr|

Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all

cricket |ˈkrɪkɪt|

the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight

归去来兮，田园将芜胡不归？既自以心为形役，奚惆怅而独悲？悟已往之不谏，知来者之可追。实迷途其未远，觉今是而昨非。舟遥遥以轻飏，风飘飘而吹衣。问征夫以前路，恨晨光之熹微。

It was a strange coincidence

heady |ˈhedi|

It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge 
I put my arm around Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me 
and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more 
but of this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism 
and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. 
A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: 
"There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired."

Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face 
floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs 
and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. 
Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again, 
closer, this time to my face.

我与盖茨比和汤姆·布坎南不同，我还没有迷哪个姑娘，迷到看着昏暗的屋檐都觉得上面飘着她的倩影，
看着炫目的招牌也觉得上面浮现出她的美貌。于是我将身边这个姑娘拉得更近，收紧了怀抱。
她那苍白的、勾着不屑的嘴唇嫣然一笑，我便再次将她拉近，贴得更紧——这一次，让她凑近我的脸。

render |ˈrendə(r)|

I realize now that under different circumstances

The automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back 
at least another minute. I had them both on their feet 
with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen 
when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.

Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. 
Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy 
and I talked looked conscientiously 
from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes. 
However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself 
I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.

reproach |rɪˈprəʊtʃ; 美 -ˈproʊtʃ|

With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or 
that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, 
admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils 
and the frothy odor of hawthorn 
and plum blossoms 
and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.

He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. 
After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. 
He had been full of the idea so long, 
dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, 
so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. 
Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock.

As I went over to say goodbye 
I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby's face, 
as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness.

He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, 
adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather 
that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge 
what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.

As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. 
His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear 
he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. 
I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth 
because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that voice was a deathless song.

warmth |wɔ:mθ; 美 wɔ:rmθ|


It transpired after a confused five minutes 
that the man had heard Gatsby's name around his office in a connection 
which he either wouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. 
This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out "to see."

It was a random shot

notoriety |ˌnəʊtəˈraɪəti; 美 ˌnoʊ-|
It was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. 
Gatsby's notoriety, spread about by the hundreds 
who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past, 
had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news.

Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn't easy to say.

He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, 
of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because 
they were hysterical about things 
which in his overwhelming self-absorption 
he took for granted.

his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night.

A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain

Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies 
until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene 
with an oblivious embrace.

For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination;

a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing.

An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, 
to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota.


He stayed there two weeks, 
dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, 
to destiny itself, 
and despising the janitor's work with which he was to pay his way through.

Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day 
that Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.


he transactions in Montana copper 
that made him many times a millionaire 
found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,

The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, 
the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness 
and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism of 1902.

He was employed in a vague personal capacity--while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, 
for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about 
and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby.

doings 
sober |ˈsəʊbə(r); 美 ˈsoʊ-|

The arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the continent. 
It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.

They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds 
Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.

Tom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.

Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. 
Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.

It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, 
even while I watched  I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.

It was dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning.

Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, 
bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again.

husky |ˈhʌski|
rhythmic |ˈrɪðmɪk|

When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, 
following it, in a way contralto voices have,

After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby's party 
there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. 
What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? 
What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours?

Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, 
some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, 
one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.

I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free 
and I lingered in the garden 
until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, 
until the lights were extinguished in the guest rooms overhead.

When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.

tan |tæn|

drawn |drɔ:n| adj.

He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression.

He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say:"I never loved you."
After she had obliterated three years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken.
obliterate |əˈblɪtəreɪt|


He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path 
of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flowers.

rind |raɪnd|


"I wouldn't ask too much of her," I ventured. "You can't repeat the past."
venture |ˈventʃə(r)|

lurk |lɜ:k; 美 lɜ:rk|

He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that 
he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.

The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars.

His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. 
He knew that when he kissed this girl, 
and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, 
his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, 
listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. 
Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.

Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, 
I was reminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,
that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. 
For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, 
as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. 
But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.

Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles 
which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. 
Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out--
an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.

Something was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose this occasion

Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, 
and hurried into the room.


fling |flɪŋ| (flung, flung |flʌŋ|)

"Mr. Gatsby!" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. "I'm glad to see you, sir.... Nick...."

Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck.

With a reluctant backward glance 
the well-disciplined child held to her nurse's hand and was pulled out the door, 
just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.

I went with them out to the veranda. 
On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, 
one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. 
Gatsby's eyes followed it momentarily; 
he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.

Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.

It's too hot to fuss.

They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet.

A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky.

Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.

savage |ˈsævɪdʒ|

That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm

A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. 
Daisy looked at Tom frowning and an indefinable expression, 
at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, 
as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby's face.

Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world 
and the shock had made him physically sick. 
I stared at him and then at Tom, 
who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before



That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, 
and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind.
locality |ləʊˈkæləti; 美 loʊ-|
disquieting |dɪsˈkwaɪətɪŋ|

jealous |ˈdʒeləs|

it was an expression I had often seen on women's faces 
but on Myrtle Wilson's face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable 
until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, 
were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.


 There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, 
and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. 
His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, 
were slipping precipitately from his control.

slip |slɪp|

precipitate |prɪˈsɪpɪteɪt|

The word "sensuous" had the effect of further disquieting Tom 
but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop 
and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.
sensuous|ˈsenʃuəs|

disquieting |dɪsˈkwaɪətɪŋ|

"How about the movies?"
"It's so hot," she complained. 
"You go. We'll ride around and meet you after." 
With an effort her wit rose faintly, 
"We'll meet you on some corner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes."

Tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. 

Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, 
and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. 
I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever.

dart |dɑ:t; 美 dɑ:rt|

we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.
explicable |ɪkˈsplɪkəbl; ˈeksplɪkəbl|


The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, 
though I have a sharp physical memory that, 
in the course of it, 
my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs 
and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.

The room was large and stifling, and, 
though it was already four o'clock, 
opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park.

"The thing to do is to forget about the heat," said Tom impatiently. "You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it."

Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice 
but the silence was unbroken by his "Thank you" and the soft closing of the door. 
This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.

crush |krʌʃ|
mint |mɪnt|

Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief.

I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.

Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.

Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. 
The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.

I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan 
who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin.

startle |ˈstɑ:tl; 美 ˈstɑ:rtl|

Then I turned back to Gatsby--and was startled at his expression. 
He looked--and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander 
of his garden--as if he had "killed a man." 
For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.

contempt |kənˈtempt|
babble |ˈbæbl|
slander |ˈslɑ:ndə(r); 美 ˈslæn-|

he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, 
defending his name against accusations that had not been made. 
But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so 
he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on 
as the afternoon slipped away, 
trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward 
that lost voice across the room.

tangible |ˈtændʒəbl|
struggle |ˈstrʌgl|

Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage she had had, were definitely gone.

I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over.

They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated,

I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade.

It was seven o'clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island. 
Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, 
but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me 
as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. 
incessant |ɪnˈsesnt|

exult |ɪgˈzʌlt|
exulting 
laughing |ˈlɑ:fɪŋ; 美 ˈlæfɪŋ|
clamour |ˈklæmə(r)|
tumult |ˈtju:mʌlt; 美 ˈtu:-|

Human sympathy has its limits and we were content to 
let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. 

Thirty--the promise of a decade of loneliness, 
a thinning list of single men to know, 
a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. 
But there was Jordan beside me who, unlike Daisy, 
was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age.

While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.
racket |ˈrækɪt|

invariably |ɪnˈveəriəbli; 美 -ˈver-|


Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant 
and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn't.

bound |baʊnd|

dusk |dʌsk|

waver|ˈweɪvə(r)|

The other car, the one going toward New York, 
came to rest a hundred yards beyond, 
and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson,
her life violently extinguished, 
knelt in the road and mingled her thick, 
dark blood with the dust.

mingle |ˈmɪŋgl|


Michaelis and this man reached her first 
but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, 
they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap 
and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. 
The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little 
in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.

He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until, 
as we came nearer, 
the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door 
made him automatically put on the brakes.
hushed |hʌʃt|
intent |ɪnˈtent|


I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, 
a sound which as we got out of the coupé 
and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words "Oh, my God!" 
uttered over and over in a gasping moan.

hollow |ˈhɒləʊ; 美 ˈhɑ:loʊ|
wail |weɪl|


issue |ˈɪʃu:; British English also ˈɪsju:|
incessant |ɪnˈsesnt|

gasp |gɑ:sp; 美 gæsp|


He reached up on tiptoes 
and peered over a circle of heads into the garage 
which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead. 
Then he made a harsh sound in his throat 
and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.

expostulate |ɪkˈspɒstʃuleɪt; 美 ɪkˈspɑ:s-|
expostulation |ɪkˌspɒstʃuˈleɪʃn; 美 ɪkˌspɑ:s-|


Myrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket 
and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night 
lay on a work table by the wall 
and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless.

Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk 
and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes 
addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.

incoherent |ˌɪnkəʊˈhɪərənt; 美 ˌɪnkoʊˈhɪr-|

gruff |grʌf|
soothe |su:ð|

Wilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes 
and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.

truculent |ˈtrʌkjələnt|

Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.

impulse |ˈɪmpʌls|

suspiciously |səˈspɪʃəsli|

snap |snæp|

we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, 
case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.


Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend
then his foot came down hard 
and the coupé raced along through the night. 
In a little while I heard a low husky sob 
and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.

husky |ˈhʌski|

dispose |dɪˈspəʊz; 美 dɪˈspoʊz|

I'd be damned if I'd go in; 
I'd had enough of all of them for one day 
and suddenly that included Jordan too.

I hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. 
bush |bʊʃ|

luminous |ˈlu:mɪnəs|

Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; 
I wouldn't have been surprised to see sinister faces, 
the faces of "Wolfshiem's people," behind him in the dark shrubbery.

"She'll be all right tomorrow," he said presently. 
"I'm just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. 
She's locked herself into her room 
and if he tries any brutality she's going to turn the light out and on again."

I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps.

I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. 
The blind was drawn but I found a rift at the sill.

There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.

He put his hands in his coat pockets 
and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, 
as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. 
So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight--watching over nothing.

Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open 
and he was leaning against a table in the hall, 
heavy with dejection or sleep.

His house had never seemed so enormous to me 
as it did that night 
when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. 

We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches

In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact 
with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between.

He found her excitingly desirable. 
desirable |dɪˈzaɪərəbl|


he had never been in such a beautiful house before. 
But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there


it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him


There was a ripe mystery about it, 
a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, 
of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances 
that were not musty and laid away already in lavender 
but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining motor cars 
and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered.

It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased her value in his eyes. 
He felt their presence all about the house, 
pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.

pervade |pəˈveɪd; 美 pərˈv-|

However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, 
he was at present a penniless young man without a past, 
and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders.

He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses.

I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security;
phantom |ˈfæntəm|

he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herself--that he was fully able to take care of her.
stratum |ˈstrɑ:təm; 美 ˈstreɪtəm|

As a matter of fact he had no such facilities--he had no comfortable family standing behind him 
and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.

Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves,
of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, 
safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.

Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, 
getting deeper in love every minute, 
and all of a sudden I didn't care. 
What was the use of doing great things 
if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?

tranquil |ˈtræŋkwɪl|

The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while 
as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.
They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another 
than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's shoulder or 
when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.

After the armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead.

For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of 
orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes.

All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the "Beale Street Blues" 
while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. 
At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that 
throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever, 
while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.

Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season;


suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men 
and drowsing asleep at dawn 
with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress 
tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed.

And all the time something within her was crying for a decision.

That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. 
There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person 
and his position and Daisy was flattered. 
Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. 
The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.

It was dawn now on Long Island and 
we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, 
filling the house with grey turning, gold turning light.

The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and 
ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. 
There was a slow pleasant movement in the air, 
scarcely a wind, promising a cool lovely day.

I was some kind of cheap sharper.

What could you make of that,

Then out into the spring fields,

The track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, 
as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city 
where she had drawn her breath. 
He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, 
to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. 
But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes 
and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.

Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time--there were boys 
who had seen a man "acting sort of crazy" and 
motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road.

The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, 
that he "had a way of finding out," supposed that 
he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car.

He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and

The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing,

After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, 
his mouth ajar, 
his face flushed slightly, 
his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. 
He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, 
and when he looked around him now for the first time and 
saw the height and splendor of the hall and 
the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride.

That night an obviously frightened person called up and 
demanded to know who I was before he would give his name.

I was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsby's grave. 
I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd 
so I'd been calling up a few people myself.

One of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and 
later from college at Christmas time. 
Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station 
at six o'clock of a December evening 
with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gayeties 
to bid them a hasty goodbye.

When we pulled out into the winter night and 
the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and 
twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, 
a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. 
We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner 
through the cold vestibules, 
unutterably aware of our identity with this country 
for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again.

That's my middle west--not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns but 
the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and 
the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and 
the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. 
I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, 
a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family's name. 
I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and 
perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.
