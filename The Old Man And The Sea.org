He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had
gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.

skiff |skɪf|

It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and 
he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or 
the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast.

gaff |gæf|

sail |seɪl| noun

The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, 
it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.

The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck.
The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer 
the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea 
were on his cheeks.

wrinkle |ˈrɪŋkl|

tropic |ˈtrɒpɪk; 美 ˈtrɑ:pɪk|

blotch |blɒtʃ; 美 blɑ:tʃ|

benevolent |bəˈnevələnt|

The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and 
his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. 
But none of these scars were fresh. 
They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man
and he was not angry. 
Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. 
But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current 
and the depths they had drifted their lines at 
and the steady good weather 
and of what they had seen.

drift |drɪft|

 
The successful fishermen of that day were already in 
and had butchered their marlin out 
and carried them 
laid full length across two planks,
with two men staggering at the end of each plank, 
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. 
Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove
where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, 
their livers removed, their fins cut off 
and their hides skinned out 
and their flesh cut into strips for salting.

When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory; 
but today there was only the faint edge of the odour 
because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off 
and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.

I can remember the tail slapping and banging

and the sweet blood smell all over me.

They picked up the gear from the boat. 
The old man carried the mast on his shoulder 
and the boy carried the wooden boat 
with the coiled, hard braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft.

No one would steal from the old man 
but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home 
as the dew was bad for them and, 
though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, 
the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations 
to leave in a boat.（​​不定式短语作后置定语​​，修饰 temptations）

They walked up the road together to the old man's shack 
and went in through its open door. 

shack |ʃæk| noun

The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall 
and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it. 
shack |ʃæk| noun
wrap |ræp|

The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. 
The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm 
which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, 
and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal. 

tough |tʌf|

charcoal |ˈtʃɑ:kəʊl; 美 ˈtʃɑ:rkoʊl|


On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano 
there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre. 
These were relics of his wife.
Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall 
but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it 
and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.

When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. 
The boy took the old army blanket off the bed 
and spread it over the back of the chair 
and over the old man’s shoulders. 
They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, 
and the neck was still strong too 
and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep 
and his head fallen forward. 
His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail 
and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun. 
The old man’s head was very old though 
and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face. 
The newspaper lay across his knees 
and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze. 
He was barefooted.

He rolled himself in the blanket 
and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.

spring |sprɪŋ|

He was asleep in a short time 
and he dreamed of Africa (when he was a boy)
and the long golden beaches 
and the white beaches, (so white they hurt your eyes,) 
and the high capes and the great brown mountains. 
He lived along that coast now every night 
and in his dreams he heard the surf roar
and saw the native boats come riding through it. 
He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept 
and he smelled the smell of Africa 
that the land breeze brought 
at morning.


cape |keɪp|

surf |sɜ:f; 美 sɜ:rf|

tar |tɑ:(r)|
oakum |ˈəʊkəm; 美 ˈoʊkəm|

Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy.
But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early
and he knew it was too early in his dream 
and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea 
and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.

peak |pi:k|
roadstead |'roʊdsted|




He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, 
nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. 
He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. 
They played like young cats in the dusk 
and he loved them as he loved the boy.
He never dreamed about the boy. 

occurrence |əˈkʌrəns; 美 əˈkɜ:r-|

He urinated outside the shack 
and then went up the road to wake the boy. 
He was shivering with the morning cold. 
But he knew he would shiver himself warm 
and that soon he would be rowing.

The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked 
and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. 
The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room 
and the old man could see him clearly with the light 
that came in from the dying moon. 

He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke 
and turned and looked at him.
The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, 
sitting on the bed, pulled them on.

They walked down the road to the old man’s shack 
and all along the road, 
in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.

The old man drank his coffee slowly. 
It was all he would have all day
and he knew that he should take it. 
For a long time now eating had bored
him and he never carried a lunch. 
He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff 
and that was all he needed for the day.

skiff |skɪf|


The boy was back now with the sardines 
and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper 
and they went down the trail to the skiff, 
feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, 
and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.

trail |treɪl|
pebble |ˈpebl|

slide |slaɪd| (slid, slid |slɪd|)

He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, 
leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, 
he began to row out of the harbour in the dark. 
There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea 
and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars 
even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills.

Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. 
But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. 
They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour 
and each one headed for the part of the ocean
where he hoped to find fish. 

apart |əˈpɑ:t; 美 əˈpɑ:rt| adv.
 
 
The old man knew he was going far out 
and he left the smell of the land behind 
and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.

He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water 
as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well 
because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms
where all sorts of fish congregated 
because of the swirl the current 
made against the steep walls of the floor of the ocean. 

Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish 
and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes 
and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.

In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming 
and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water 
and the hissing (that their stiff set wings made) as they soared away in the darkness. 
He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. 


He was sorry for the birds,( especially the small delicate dark terns同位语 )
that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, 
and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do 
except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones. 

Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows 
when the ocean can be so cruel? 


She(代指 the ocean) is kind and very beautiful.
But she can be so cruel 
and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, 
with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea.

He always thought of the sea as la mar 
which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. 
Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her 
but they are always said as though she were a woman. 


Some of the younger fishermen, 
those who used buoys as floats for their lines 
and had motorboats,  (bought when the shark livers had brought much money,过去分词短语作非限制性定语，修饰 motorboats) 
spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. 
They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. 
But the old man always thought of her as feminine
and as something that gave or withheld great favours, 
and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. 
The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.

He was rowing steadily 
and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed 
and the surface of the ocean was flat 
except for the occasional swirls of the current. 

He was letting the current do a third of the work
and as it started to be light 
he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.

I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. 
Today I’ll work out where the schools of bonito and albacore are

Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. 
drift |drɪft|


One bait was down forty fathoms. 
The second was at seventy-five
and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred 
and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. 

Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid 
and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines.

Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on the projecting steel. 

There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting.

The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, 
which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, 
on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; 
but they were in good condition still 
and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness.

Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick 
so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip 
and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast
to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line.

Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff 
and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. 
It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise.

straight up and down

The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, 
low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. 
Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, 
as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes 
so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it.

He looked down into the water 
and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. 


He kept them straighter than anyone did, 
so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait

for any fish that swam there.

Others let them drift with the current 
and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen
thought they were at a hundred.


But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. 
But who knows?  Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky.

As he watched 
the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive 
and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually 
as he followed the flying fish.
The old man could see the slight bulge in the water 
that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish. 
The dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish 
and would be in the water, driving at speed,  when the fish dropped. 
It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. 
They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. 
The bird has no chance. 
The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.

They were immune to its poison. 
But men were not and when some of the filaments would catch on a line

He loved green turtles(绿海龟) and hawk-bills(玳瑁)

He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years. 
He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton. 
Most people are heartless about turtles 
because a turtle’s heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered.
But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs. 
He ate the white eggs to give himself strength.

He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack

Most fishermen hated the taste.

No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish. 
But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air,

He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, 
his big, unintelligent eyes staring 
as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat

him stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the weight increased

It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily.

Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again. 
But the fish only continued to swim at a slightly higher level. 
The sun was on the old man’s left arm and shoulder and on his back. 
So he knew the fish had turned east of north.


Now that he had seen him once, 
he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings

They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees could sleep.

But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again. 
He was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten. 
And at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw 
and the referee was shaking his head, 
he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood. 
The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended on a Monday morning. 
Many of the bettors had asked for a draw
because they had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company. 
Otherwise everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish. 
But he had finished it anyway and before anyone had to go to work.

For a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion 
and there had been a return match in the spring. 
But not much money was bet
and he had won it quite easily 
since he had broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match. 
After that he had a few matches
and then no more. 

He decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to (badly enough) 
and he decided that it was bad for his right hand for fishing.
He had tried a few practice matches with his left hand. 
But his left hand had always been a traitor 
and would not do (what he called on it to do 宾语从句) and he did not trust it.

(Why is it that) all the fast-moving fish of the dark current 
have purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots? 

The dolphin looks green (of course) because he is really golden. 
But when he comes to feed, truly hungry, purple stripes 
show on his sides as on a marlin. 
(Can it be anger), or (the greater speed he makes that brings them out)?


Just before it was dark,

he pulled the dolphin (in) with his left hand, 
stepping on the gained line (each time) with his bare left foot.

When the fish was at the stem, plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation, 
the old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over the stem. 
Its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against the hook 
and it pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body,  its tail and its head 
until he clubbed it across the shining golden head 
until it shivered and was still.

The setting of the sun is a difficult time for all fish.
He let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line with it and eased himself as much as he could

and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water.

and putting his knife back in its sheath, 
he worked his way slowly back to the bow.

that stretched for eight or ten miles 
and it was in the time of their mating
and they would leap high into the air 
and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped.

Then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther 
and he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his head
had rested on it instead of a pillow.

After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach 
and he saw the first of the lions come down onto it in the early dark
and then the other lions came 
and he rested his chin on the wood of the bows 
where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore breeze 
and he waited to see if there would be more lions 
and he was happy.

He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face 
and the line burning out through his right hand. 
He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right 
and the line rushed out.
Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line 
and now it burned his back and his left hand, 
and his left hand was taking all the strain and (was 省略) cutting badly. 

He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly. 
Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall. 
Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although line was still racing out 
and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point 
and raising it to breaking point again and again.
He had been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin 
and he could not move.

He could not see the fish’s jumps but only heard the breaking of the ocean 
and the heavy splash as he fell.

The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now 
and he was making the fish (earn each inch of it 宾语补足语 (Object Complement)). 
Now he got his head up from the wood 
and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed. 
Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet. 
He was ceding line but more slowly all he time. 
He worked back to where he could feel (with his foot) the coils of line that he could not see. 
There was plenty of line still

And now he has jumped more than a dozen times 
and filled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die
where I cannot bring him up. 
He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. 

I wonder what started him so suddenly? 
Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, 
or was he frightened by something in the night? 
Maybe he suddenly felt fear. 
But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. 
It is strange.

The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now 
and stooped down and scooped up water in his right hand 
to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face. 

He was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength. 
When his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side 
and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise. 
He’s headed almost east, he thought. 
That means he is tired and going with the current. 
Soon he will have to circle. 
Then our true work begins.

After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough
he took it out and looked at it.

on the other side of the skiff.

When he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and
he thought he should chew some more of the dolphin. 
But I can’t, he told himself. 
It is better to be light-headed than to lose your strength from nausea. 
And I know I cannot keep it if I eat it since my face was in it. 
I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad. 
But it is too late to try for strength now through nourishment. 
You’re stupid, he told himself. 
Eat the other flying fish.

Now I have done what I can, he thought. 
Let him begin to circle and let the fight come.

when the fish started to circle.

[自从他出海以来，太阳已是第三次升起，就在这时，那条鱼开始绕圈了;]

He could not see (by the slant of the line) that the fish was circling. 
It was too early for that. 
He just felt a faint slackening (of the pressure of the line) 
and he commenced to pull on it gently with his right hand. 
It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the point where it would break, line began to come in.

His old legs and shoulders pivoted (with the swinging of the pulling).

Then the line would not come in any more

But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat

and the sweat salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead.

They were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line.

Then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck.

It was a great temptation to rest in the bow 
and let the fish make one circle by himself without recovering any line. 
But when the strain showed
the fish had turned to come toward the boat, 
the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling
that brought in all the line he gained.

But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty yards away 
and the man saw his tail out of water. 
It was higher than a big scythe blade and (省略了 was) a very pale lavender above the dark blue water.

He had rigged his harpoon long before

He tried it once more 
and he felt himself going when he turned the fish.

and swam off again slowly 
with the great tail weaving in the air.



I’ll try it again, the old man promised, 
although his hands were mushy now 
and he could only see well in flashes.

He tried it again and it was the same. 
So he thought, and he felt himself going before he started;

He took all his pain 
and what was left of his strength 
and his long gone pride 
and he put it against the fish’s agony

The old man dropped the line 
and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon (as high as he could 方式状语从句修饰 lifted)
and drove it down with all his strength, 
(and more strength he had just summoned 同位语), 
into the fish’s side just behind the great chest fin

He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it 
and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it.

Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, 
and rose high out of the water (showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty).

Then he fell into the water with a crash

when he could see, he saw the fish was on his back with his silver belly up.
The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the fish’s shoulder
and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart. 
First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep.
Then it spread like a cloud. 
The fish was silvery and still and floated with the waves.

The old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had.
Then he took two turns of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow 
and hid his head on his hands



Now I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he thought. 
Even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out, 
this skiff would never hold him. 
I must prepare everything, 
then bring him in 
and lash him well 
and step the mast 
and set sail for home.

He started to pull the fish in to have him alongside 
so that he could pass a line through his gills and out his mouth 
and make his head fast alongside the bow. 
I want to see him, he thought, and to touch and to feel him. 
He is my fortune, he thought. 
But that is not why I wish to feel him. 
I think I felt his heart, he thought. When I pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time. 
Bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose around his tail 
and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff.

When he was even with him 
and had the fish’s head against the bow he could not believe his size. 
But he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt,
passed it through the fish’s gills and out his jaws, 
made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill, 
made another turn around the bill

He made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart. 
He was so big (that 省略) it was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside. 
He cut a piece of line and tied the fish’s lower jaw against his bill 
so his mouth would not open 
and they would sail as cleanly as possible. 
Then he stepped the mast and, (with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged, the patched sail drew,)
the boat began to move, 
and half lying in the stern he sailed south-west.

He did not need a compass to tell him where southwest was. 
He only needed the feel of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail.

So he hooked a patch of yellow Gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it 
so that the small shrimps ( that were in it) fell onto the planking of the skiff. 
There were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas. 
The old man pinched their heads off (with his thumb and forefinger)
and ate them (chewing up the shells and the tails). 
They were very tiny but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good.

The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle 
and he used half of one after he had eaten the shrimps. 
The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps 
and he steered with the tiller under his arm. 
He could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands 
and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened 
and was not a dream. 

At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, 
he had thought perhaps it was a dream. 
Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water 
and hang motionless in the sky before he fell, 
he was sure there was some great strangeness and he could not believe it.

Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever. 
Now he knew there was the fish 
and his hands and back were no dream. 
The hands cure quickly, he thought. 
I bled them clean and the salt water will heal them. 
The dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer (that there is).

All I must do is keep the head clear. 
The hands have done their work and we sail well. 
[With his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down] we sail like brothers. 
Then his head started to become a little unclear 
and he thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? 
If I were towing him behind there would be no question. 
Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, 
there would be no question either. 
But they were sailing together lashed side by side
and the old man thought, 
let him bring me in if it pleases him. 
I am only better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm.

They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water 
and tried to keep his head clear. 
There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them 
so that the old man knew the breeze would last all night.
The old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true. 
It was an hour before the first shark hit him.

The shark was not an accident. 
He had come up from deep down in the water 
as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the (mile deep) sea. 
He had come up 
so fast and absolutely without caution 
that he broke the surface of the blue water 
and was in the sun. 
Then he fell back into the sea 
and picked up the scent 
and started swimming on the course (the skiff and the fish had taken.)

Sometimes he lost the scent. 
But he would pick it up again, or (he would 省略) have just a trace of it, 
and he swam fast and hard on the course. 
He was a very big Mako shark [built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the sea 过去分词短语作后置定语] 
and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws. 


His back was as blue as a sword fish’s 
and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome. 

He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws 
which were tight shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface 
with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering. 


Now he speeded up (as he smelled the fresher scent) 
and his blue dorsal fin cut the water.

Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards. 
They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped teeth of most sharks. 
They were shaped like a man’s fingers [when they are crisped like claws].

 
They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man 
and they had razor-sharp cutting edges on both sides. 
This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea, 
that were so fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy.

When the old man saw him coming he knew 
that this was a shark that had no fear at all 
and would do exactly what he wished. 
He prepared the harpoon and made the rope fast 
while he watched the shark come on. 
The rope was short 
as it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish.

The old man’s head was clear and good now 
and he was full of resolution but he had little hope. 
It was too good to last, he thought. 
He took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark close in. 
It (might as well have been) a dream, he thought. 
I cannot keep him from hitting me but maybe I can get him. 
Dentuso, he thought. Bad luck to your mother.

The shark closed fast astern 
and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open 
and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth 
as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail. 
The shark’s head was out of water 
and his back was coming out and the old man could hear 
the noise of [skin and flesh ripping] on the big fish 
when he rammed the harpoon down onto the shark’s head 
at a spot [where the line between his eyes intersected with the line (that ran straight back from his nose)]. 

There were no such lines. 
There was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the clicking, thrusting all-swallowing jaws. 
But that was the location of the brain and the old man hit it. 
He hit it [with his blood mushed hands] [driving a good harpoon with all his strength]. 
He hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy.

The shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive 
and then he swung over once again, wrapping himself in two loops of the rope.
The old man knew that he was dead but the shark would not accept it. 
Then,on his back, with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking, 
the shark plowed over the water as a speedboat does. 
The water was white where his tail beat it 
and three-quarters of his body was clear above the water 
when the rope came taut, shivered, and then snapped. 
The shark lay quietly for a little while on the surface 
and the old man watched him. 
Then he went down very slowly.

He did not like to look at the fish anymore

I wish it had been a dream now

and was alone in bed on the newspapers.

“But man is not made for defeat,” he said. 
“A man can be destroyed but not defeated.” 
I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought. 
Now the bad time is coming and I do not even have the harpoon. 
The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent. 
But I was more intelligent than he was. 
Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed.

“Don’t think, old man,” he said aloud.

The breeze was fresh now 
and he sailed on well. 
He watched only the forward part of the fish 
and some of his hope returned.




It is silly not to hope, he thought. 
Besides I believe it is a sin. 
Do not think about sin, he thought. 
There are enough problems now without sin.
Also I have no understanding of it.


I have no understanding of it 
and I am not sure that I believe in it.
Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish. 
I suppose it was (even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many people). 
But then everything is a sin.
Do not think about sin. 
It is much too late for that and there are people who are paid to do it. 
Let them think about it. 
You were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish. 

San Pedro was a fisherman

But he liked to think about all things that he was involved in 
and since there was nothing to read 
and he did not have a radio, 
he thought much and he kept on thinking about sin. 
You did not kill the fish only to keep alive
and to sell for food, he thought. 
You killed him for pride 
and because you are a fisherman. 
You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after.
If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?



But you enjoyed killing the dentuso, he thought. 
He lives on the live fish as you do. 
He is not a scavenger nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are.

He leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish
where the shark had cut him. 
He chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste. 
It was firm and juicy, like meat, but it was not red. 
There was no stringiness in it 
and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the market. 
But there was no way to keep its scent out of the water 
and the old man knew that a very had time was coming.

The breeze was steady. 
It had backed a little further into the north-east
and he knew that meant that it would not fall off. 
The old man looked ahead of him 
but he could see no sails nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship. 
There were only the flying fish
