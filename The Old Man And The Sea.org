He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had
gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.

the Gulf Stream


It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and 
he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or 
the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast.

The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, 
it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.

sack |sæk|  noun verb


The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck.
The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer 
the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea 
were on his cheeks.

wrinkle |ˈrɪŋkl|

tropic |ˈtrɒpɪk; 美 ˈtrɑ:pɪk|

The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and 
his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. 
But none of these scars were fresh. 
They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
