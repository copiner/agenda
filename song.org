Scarborough Fair  

Are you going to Scarborough Fair  |'skɑr,bəro|
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme  |ˈpɑ:sli| |seɪdʒ| |ˈrəʊzməri| |taɪm|
Remember me to one who lives there
He once was a true love of mine

Tell him to make me a cambric shirt

Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme     |ˈpɑ:sli| |seɪdʒ| |ˈrəʊzməri| |taɪm|
Without no seams nor needle work      |si:m|  |ˈni:dl|
Then he'll be a true love of mine 

Tell him to find me an acre of land    |tel hɪm|
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme   |ˈpɑ:sli| |seɪdʒ| |ˈrəʊzməri| |taɪm|
Between salt water and the sea strands
Then he'll be a true love of mine

Tell him to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme            |ˈpɑ:sli| |seɪdʒ| |ˈrəʊzməri| |taɪm|
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then he'll be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
He once was a true love of mine


Cry on my shoulder

If the hero never comes to you
If you need someone you're feeling blue
If you wait for love and you're alone
If you call your friends nobody's home
You can run away but you can't hide
Through a storm and through a lonely night

Then I'll show you there's a destiny
The best things in life they are free

But if you wanna cry
Cry on my shoulder

If you need someone
Who cares for you
If you're feeling sad
Your heart gets colder
Yes I show you what real love can do

If your sky is grey oh let me know
There's a place in heaven where we'll go

If heaven is a million miles away
Oh just call me and I'll make your day
When the nights are getting cold and blue
When the days are getting hard for you

I will always stay here by your side
I promise you I'll never hide

But if you wanna cry
Cry on my shoulder
If you need someone
Who cares for you

If you're feeling sad
Your heart gets colder
Yes I show you what real love can do

But if you wanna cry
Cry on my shoulder
If you need someone
Who cares for you
If you're feeling sad
Your heart gets colder
Yes I show you what real love can do
What real love can do


The Sound Of Silence

Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping                   |ˈvɪʒn| |ˈsɒftli; 美 ˈsɔ:ftli|
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping 
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

 
In restless dreams I walked alone                  |ˈrestləs|
Narrow streets of cobblestone                      |ˈkɑ:blstoʊn|
Neath the halo of a street lamp                    |ˈheɪləʊ; 美 -loʊ|      |læmp|
I turned my collar to the cold and damp            |ˈkɒlə(r); 美 ˈkɑ:l-|       |dæmp|
When my eyes were stabbed by                       |stæb|
The flash of a neon light                          |ˈni:ɒn; 美 ˈni:ɑ:n|
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people maybe more
People talking without speaking                     |wɪˈðaʊt|
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

Fools said I you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed               |baʊ|
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out it's warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said
The words of the prophets are                 |ˈprɒfɪt; 美 ˈprɑ:f-|
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls                            |ˈtenəmənt|  |hɔ:l|
And whispered in the sound of silence



The day you went away


Oh, oh, ooh

Well, I wonder

Could it be?
When I was dreaming about you baby
You were dreaming of me                      |'dri:mɪŋ|   |ʌv|
Call me crazy
Call me blind

|tu| |stɪl| |bi| |ˈsʌfərɪŋ||ɪz| |ˈstju:pɪd| |ˈæftər| |ɔ:l| |ʌv| |ðɪs| |taɪm|
 To  still   be   suffering is   stupid       after all    of     this  time       

Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do, I do
You know I really really do
Well hey, so much I need to say

Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true

For me there's only you         | ðeəz ˈoʊnli|
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
Go on. Yay... Oh...

I remember - date and time
September twenty second sunday twenty five after nine
In the doorway
With your case
No longer shouting at each other
There were tears on our faces           |'feɪsɪz| | ənd|
And we were letting go of something special     |ˈspeʃl|

Something we'll never have again, I know
I guess I really really know
Well hey, so much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true
For me there's only you

Been crying since the day
The day you went away
The day you went away
The day you went away
Go on. Yay...

Oh oh oh

Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do, I do
You know I really really do
Well hey, so much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true

For me there's only you     | ðeəz ˈoʊnli|
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
Why do we never know what we've got till it's gone

How could I carry on
The day you went away
Cause I've been missing you so much I have to say
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
The day you went away
The day you went away...
Go on. Yay... Oh...
