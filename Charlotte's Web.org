Mr. Arable fixed a

"Won't he be cold at night?" asked Fern.
"No," said her father. "You watch and see what he does."

Carrying a bottle of milk, Fern sat down under the apple tree inside the yard.
Wilbur ran to her and she held the bottle for him while he
sucked. When he had finished the last drop, he grunted and walked sleepily into
the box. Fern peered through the door. Wilbur was poking the straw with his
snout. In a short time he had dug a tunnel in the straw. He crawled into the
tunnel and disappeared from sight, completely covered with straw.
Fern was enchanted. It relieved her mind to know that her baby would sleep
covered up, and would stay warm.

One warm afternoon, Fern and Avery put on bathing suits and went down to the
brook for a swim. Wilbur tagged along at Fern's heels. When she waded into
the brook, Wilbur waded in with her. He found the water quite cold - too cold for his
liking. So while the children swam and played and splashed water at each other,
Wilbur amused himself in the mud along the edge of the brook, where it was warm
and moist and delightfully sticky and oozy.

Wilbur heard the words of praise. He felt the warm milk inside his
stomach. He felt the pleasant rubbing of the stick along his itchy

The next day was rainy and dark. Rain fell on the roof of the barn and dripped
steadily from the eaves. Rain fell in the barnyard and ran in crooked courses
down into the lane where thistles and pigweed grew. Rain spattered against Mrs.
Zuckerman's kitchen windows and came gushing out of the downspouts. Rain fell
on the backs of the sheep as they grazed in the meadow. When the sheep tired
of standing in the rain, they walked slowly up the lane and into the fold.

small voice he had never heard before. It sounded rather thin, but pleasant.

down for his morning nap, he heard again the thin voice that had addressed him
the night before.

exterior |ɪkˈstɪəriə(r); 美 -ˈstɪr-|


Wilbur was merely suffering the doubts and fears that often go with finding a new
friend. In good time he was to discover that he was mistaken about Charlotte.
Underneath her rather bold and cruel exterior, she had a kind heart, and she was to
prove loyal and true to the very end.

The early summer days on a farm are the happiest and fairest days of the year.
Lilacs bloom and make the air sweet, and then fade. Apple blossoms come with
the lilacs, and the bees visit around among the apple trees. The days grow warm
and soft. School ends, and children have time to play and to fish for trouts in the
brook. Avery often brought a trout home in his pocket, warm and stiff and ready to
be fried for supper.

swathe |sweɪð|

rake and pitch

hoist |hɔɪst|

Around the first of July, the work horses were hitched to the mowing
machine, and Mr. Zuckerman climbed into the seat and drove into the field. All
morning you could hear the rattle of the machine as it went round and round, while
the tall grass fell down behind the cutter bar in long green swathes. Next day, if
there was no thunder shower, all hands would help rake and pitch and load, and
the hay would be hauled to the barn in the high hay wagon, with Fern and Avery
riding at the top of the load. Then the hay would be hoisted, sweet and warm, into
the big loft, until the whole barn seemed like a wonderful bed of timothy and clover.
It was fine to jump in, and perfect to hide in. And sometimes Avery would find a
little grass snake in the hay, and would add it to the other things in his pocket.

Frigidaire is full of ice-cold drinks. Everywhere you look is life; even the little ball of
spit on the weed stalk, if you poke it apart, has a green worm inside it.And on the
under side of the leaf of the potato vine are the bright orange eggs of the potato
bug.

quitter |ˈkwɪtə(r)|

Charlotte watched in delight. Like Fern, she was truly fond of Wilbur, whose

and another right to the fin. Then a hard left to the head, while the web swayed
and stretched.

heard the cricket song and turned bright red with anxiety.

A fair is a
rat's paradise. Everybody spills food at a fair. A rat can
creep out late at night and have a feast. In the horse barn you will
find oats that the trotters and pacers have spilled. In the trampled
grass of the infield you will find old discarded lunch boxes containing
the foul remains of peanut butter sandwiches, hard-boiled eggs, cracker crumbs,
bits of doughnuts, and particles of cheese.In the hard-packed dirt of the midway,
after the glaring lights are out and the people have gone home to bed, you will find
a veritable treasure of popcorn fragments, frozen custard dribblings, candied
apples abandoned by tired children, sugar fluff crystals, salted almonds, popsicles,
partially gnawed ice cream cones, and the wooden sticks of lollypops. 
Everywhere is loot for a rat - in tents, in booths, in hay lofts - why, a fair has enough
disgusting leftover food to satisfy a whole army of rats.

squashed, or buffeted about, or bruised, or lacerated, or scarred, or biffed (hit, strike).

Mr. Arable gave Fern two quarters and two
dimes. He gave Avery five dimes and four nickels. "Now run along!" he said.
"And remember, the money has to last all day. Don't spend it all the first few
minutes. And be back here at the truck at noontime so we can all have lunch
together. And don't eat a lot of stuff that's going to make you sick to your
stomachs."

"And if you go in those swings," said Mrs. Arable, "you hang on tight!
You hang on very tight. Hear me?"

"And don't get lost!" said Mrs. Zuckerman.

"And don't get dirty!"

"Don't get overheated!" said their mother.

"Watch out for pickpockets!" cautioned their father.

"And don't cross the race track when the horses are coming!"
cried Mrs. Zuckerman.

These autumn days will shorten and grow cold. The leaves will shake loose from
the trees and fall. Christmas will come, then the snows of winter. You will live to
enjoy the beauty of the frozen world, for you mean a great deal to Zuckerman and
he will not harm you, ever. Winter will pass, the days will lengthen, the ice will
melt in the pasture pond. The song sparrow will return and sing, the frogs will
awake, the warm wind will blow again. All these sights and sounds and smells will
be yours to enjoy, Wilbur - this lovely world, these precious days

The autumn days grew shorter, Lurvy brought the squashes and pumpkins in from
the garden and piled them on the barn floor, where they wouldn't get nipped on
frosty nights. The maples and birches turned bright colors and the wind shook
them and they dropped their leaves one by one to the ground. Under the wild
apple trees in the pasture, the red little apples lay thick on the ground, and the
sheep gnawed them and the geese gnawed them and foxes came in the night and
sniffed them. One evening, just before Christmas, snow began falling. It
covered house and barn and fields and woods. Wilbur had never seen snow
before. When morning came he went out and plowed the drifts in his yard, for the
fun of it. Fern and Avery arrived, dragging a sled. They coasted down the lane
and out onto the frozen pond in the pasture.

The snows melted and ran away. The streams and ditches bubbled and
chattered with rushing water. A sparrow with a streaky breast arrived and sang.
The light strengthened, the mornings came sooner. Almost every morning there
was another new lamb in the sheepfold. The goose was sitting on nine eggs.
The sky seemed wider and a warm wind blew. The last remaining strands of
Charlotte's old web floated away and vanished.

stripe |straɪp|

tan |tæn|

One fine sunny morning, after breakfast, Wilbur stood watching his
precious sac. He wasn't thinking of anything much. As he stood there, he noticed
something move. He stepped closer and stared. A tiny spider crawled from the
sac. It was no bigger than a grain of sand, no bigger than the head of a pin.
Its body was grey with a black stripe underneath. Its legs were grey and tan. It
looked just like Charlotte.

Then came a quiet morning when Mr. Zuckerman opened a door on the north side.
A warm draft of rising air blew softly through the barn cellar. The air smelled of the
damp earth, of the spruce woods, of the sweet springtime. The baby spiders felt
the warm updraft. One spider climbed to the top of the fence. Then it did
something that came as a great surprise to Wilbur. The spider stood on its head,
pointed its spinnerets in the air, and let loose a cloud of fine silk. The silk formed a
balloon. As Wilbur watched, the spider let go of the fence and rose into the air.

"Joy! Aranea! Nellie!" he began. "Welcome to the barn cellar. You have
chosen a hallowed doorway from which to string your webs. I think it is only fair to
tell you that I was devoted to your mother. I owe my very life to her. She was
brilliant, beautiful, and loyal to the end. I shall always treasure her memory. To
you, her daughters, I pledge my friendship, forever and ever."



"I pledge mine," said Joy.
"I do, too," said Aranea.
"And so do I," said Nellie, who had just managed to catch a small gnat.
It was a happy day for Wilbur. And many more happy, tranquil days followed.
